Not only does this prove that other dinosaurs had wings, a theory which has become widely accepted, but it provides insight into the structures of the vertebrae which cannot be provided by mere bone structure - something about the color, shape, and triangular arrangement.
Scientists identify the animal as brown with chestnut above and a shade of orange or carotenoid below.
These findings provide insight into the changes in a bird's wing movements.
Because dinosaur feathers are shaped into a pattern of vertical cords called rachis, but also possess the characteristics of feathers - barbs and barbules - the researchers suggested the rachis may have been thicker than the other feathers.
The shape of the feathers suggests they were not used for flight but rather for thermo or display control. The researchers suggest that, although this is a small dinosaur tail, the specimen shows adult feathers instead of pupals on the ground.
Researchers suggest that, although it is a small dinosaur tail, the sample shows the feathers of an adult rather than a young plumage.

Dr. Tony Moll identified extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis (XDR-TB) in the province of KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa.
In an interview, he said that the specific new burn was "highly distressing and shocking because of the high mortality rate".

In France, the voting law is a low-tech practice: voters go into the voting booths and show a printed paper that specifies the party they have chosen.
After the officials have confirmed the voter's identification, the voter casts a ballot in the voting box and marks the ballot paper.

Since 1988, ballot boxes have been required to be transparent so that voters and electoral officials can verify that there are no envelopes present at the start of voting and that no additional envelopes have been added other than those that have been counted and authorized by voters.
Candidates may send representatives to witness every aspect of the process. In the evenings, the votes are counted by volunteers under strict supervision, following special procedures.

She was transferred to Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge.
Adekoya has since been in the Edinburgh Sheriff Court charged with killing his son.
He is still being held on charges and awaiting sentencing, but the credibility of witnesses may have been compromised due to the widespread distribution of his photograph.
This is a common practice elsewhere in the UK, but Scotland's justice system works in a different way and courts have seen the publication of photos as potentially preventative.
Professor Pamela Ferguson of the University of Dundee writes "The risks in the lives of journalists lie with the publication of confidential photographs and other information about the individual who caused the harm".
The Crown Office, responsible for criminal prosecutions, told a reporter that no further action would be taken until at least charges have been laid.
The draft mentioned that it is also in dispute and includes some Palestinian demands for borders concerning the pre-1967 Mideast conflict.
Other subjects discussed include the future status of the holy Jerusalem for both nations and the Jordan Valley.
Israel calls for a continuous military presence on the plain for ten years after the agreement is signed, while the PA agrees to only leave such a presence for five years.
In an extended case of insect control, the shooters would be closely monitored by the keepers, as the case was being monitored and its performance tested.
In partnership with the NPWS and the Sports Shooters Association of Australia (NSW) Inc, eligible volunteers are recruited under the Sporting Shooter Association's search program.
According to Mick O'Flynn, the Acting Director of Park Conservation and Heritage at NPWS, the first four shooters to be licensed to shoot have received full security training.
Martelly inaugurated the new Provisional Electoral Council (CEP) with its members taking oath yesterday.
Martelly's fifth year in the CEP lasted for four years.
Last month, a presidential commission recommended, ahead of the fall of the CEP, a set of measures to move the country closer to a vote.
The movement was Martelly's response to the growing demands for change that had recently begun in October.
Another protest was a long march that was against the postponement of the vote, which was supposed to be held in 2011.
60 instances of iPod malfunction have been reported, causing six fires and leaving four people with minor burns.
Japan's Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) said they were aware of 27 hazards associated with weapons.
Last week, METI announced that Apple reported 34 incidents of abnormally high temperatures, an event the company said "was not significant."
After Apple withdrew the release, the department took a deep breath and called it "a disaster."
The earthquake struck Mariana at 7:19 a.m. local time (09:19 p.m. GMT on Friday).
The Northern Office of Emergency Management stated that no casualties were reported in the tribe.
The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center concluded that there were no known tsunami warning signs.
A former Filipino policeman finally detained a number of Hong Kong tourists when he raided their bus in Manila, the capital of the Philippines.
Rolando Mendoza fired his M16 at the tourists.
Several hostages have since been rescued and at least six have died so far.
The six roundups, consisting of children and adults, have been released early, as have the Filipino photographers.
The photographers took the place of an old woman who had grown as she wanted a laundry. Mendoza was fired.
Liggins followed in his father's footsteps and embarked on a career as a physician.
She trained as a gynecologist and began working at Auckland's National Women's Hospital in 1959.
While working at the hospital, Liggins began to research premature births in his spare time.
His research showed that the use of hormones could help accelerate the growth of unborn fetal lungs.
Xinhua reported that government investigators found two "black boxes" of aircraft recorders on Wednesday.
Other wrestlers paid their respects to Luna.
Tommy Dreamer said that "Luna was the first Extreme Queen. My first boss. Luna passed away two months ago at night. She was beautiful even when she was alone. A strong woman."
Dustin "Goldust" Runnels commented that "Luna was as crazy as I was ... maybe even more so ... I loved her and will miss her ... hoping she is in a better place."
Of the 1,400 polled before the 2010 election, those who oppose Australia becoming a republic rose by eight percent since 2008.
During the 2010 federal election campaign, senior minister Julia Gillard claimed that she believed Australia should be made a republic at the end of Queen Elizabeth II's reign.
34 percent of voters shared this belief, favoring Queen Elizabeth II to be Australia's last monarch.
In an extreme poll, 29 percent of those polled believe that Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, while 31 percent believe that Australia should not become a republic.
The Olympic gold medalist was supposed to compete in the 100m and 200m freestyle and in three events at the Commonwealth Games, but due to her complaints, her fitness was in question.
She has not been able to take the necessary pain medication as it is banned from sports.
Curtis Cooper, a mathematician and professor of computer science at the University of Central Missouri, has found the largest known value yet on January 25th.
The findings were confirmed by people using different hardware and software platforms in early February and were announced on Tuesday.
Ice and vapor in space may have been a source of water supply to Earth, thanks to natural processes that can produce proteins that support life.
The scientific field is trying to understand how landforms, particularly how Earth, came into existence, since the lines have been connected with Earth over the ages.
Cuomo, 53, took office earlier this year and signed same-sex marriage into law last month.
She referred to the gossip as "political motivation and cleansing."
He is expected to run for President in 2016.
NextGen is a program by the FAA that claims to allow aircraft to fly shorter distances and save millions of gallons of fuel per year, while reducing carbon emissions.
It uses advanced solar technology, unlike the old one that used technology from ground-radar, to allow air traffic controllers to accurately display air traffic and provide pilots with accurate information.
No additional vehicles are being stationed and subways won't stop at Wembley, and parking facilities and docking areas don't exist.
The fear of limited public transportation has caused concern that there may not be many supporters present for the game.
A study published on Thursday in the scientific journal Science identified a new species of bird living on the Ecuadorian Galápagos Islands.
Researchers at Princeton University in the United States and Uppsala University in Sweden reported that the new species has evolved in just two generations, although it was believed that this process takes longer, due to crossbreeding between Darwin's finches, Geospiza fortes, and the migrating cactus.
Gold can be made into a complex mixture of all sorts of structures - tiny particles, tiny particles.
The wire can be drawn thin, twisted and visible. It can be fitted with a screw or a roller and be in sheets.
It can be shaped to be very thin, and adhering to the backing of the metal, so thin that it was sometimes used to decorate hand-drawn illustrations in "light-colored manuscripts".
This is called the pH of the chemical. You can make an indicator using red cabbage juice.
The sap of a cabbage changes color depending on whether the chemical substance is acidic or alkaline.
The pH value is represented by the concentration of hydrogen (H in pH) ions in a tested chemical.
Hydrogen ions are protons that have had their electrons stripped (because hydrogen atoms have just one proton and one electron).
Shake the dry ingredients together and then, with clean hands, knead it into a paste.
Moisture in your hands is absorbed by the outer skin, which becomes cloudy and scaly.
The cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro had flushing toilets in almost every house, connected to a sophisticated plumbing system.
Remnants of waste-to-sewage technology have been found in houses from the Minoan city of Crete and Santorini in Greece.
Bathrooms existed in ancient Egypt, Persia, and China. In the Roman invention, the toilets were sometimes part of the public bathing area where men and women mingled in large amounts.
When calling someone thousands of miles away, you use a satellite.
An airborne satellite detected the signal and quickly relayed it back.
The satellite was launched into the sky by a rocket. Scientists use airborne telescopes because Earth's atmosphere interferes with our light and vision.
A rocket over 100 feet long is required to launch a satellite or telescope into space.
The wheel has revolutionized the world in many ways. It provided us with an easier and faster means of transportation.
We have been provided with trains, automobiles, and other modes of transportation.
Below them are the medium-sized cats that feed on intermediate prey ranging from rabbits to antelopes and deer.
Finally, many small cats (including wildcats) eat a large number of prey such as insects, mice, lizards, and birds.
Their secret to success is doing odd jobs, with each cat's unique and distinct performance that sets it apart from other cats.
Lion cats live together in large groups called prides.
A lion pride consists of one to three adult males, along with females and their cubs, which can number up to thirty.
Women typically develop close kinship with each other, forming a large family of sisters and their daughters.
Lion families are similar to the families of wild dogs or just dogs, animals that resemble lions in their behavior (but not other wild cats) and are very dangerous to their prey.
A good sprinter, the tiger can climb (even if not very well), run, jump long distances and has five times the strength of a strong man.
The tiger is in the same Genus (Genus Panthera) as the lion, leopard and cheetah. Only four cats have the ability to roar.
The growling of a large leopard is not the same as the full growl of a lion, but it is shorter and resembles a snarly hiss, uttered in short phrases.
Ocelots like to eat small animals. They will hunt monkeys, snakes, rats, and birds if they can. However, all the animals hunted by ocelots are much smaller than they are.
Scientists suggest that ocelots hunt and find their prey (their food) by scent, tracking their movements on the ground.
They see well in the dark with their night vision and are solitary hunters. Ocelots hunt their prey by blending in with their surroundings and then pouncing on their prey.
When a small living thing (microorganism) is separated from the mass from which it comes (e.g. transported down a mountain or to a river or to a new island from which it cannot easily return) it prefers to find itself in a different environment than it was before.
This new environment has different resources and competition, therefore new inhabitants need new inventions or adaptations to compete more effectively than the needs that existed at first.
The original inhabitants who haven't changed much, still require a similar adjustment as before.
Over time, as newcomers begin to adapt to new surroundings, they gradually begin to blend in with society.
Eventually, after thousands or even millions of years, these two people will be so different in appearance that they cannot be called the same species.
We call this process speciation, which simply means the creation of a new species is natural. Speciation is the inevitable consequence of change and is also an essential property of change.
Plants produce the oxygen that we inhale, and they absorb (in other words, exhale) the carbon dioxide that we produce.
Through a process known as photosynthesis, plants can transform sunlight into food and create shade for themselves.
We build our homes with plants and make our clothing with vegetation. Most of the food we eat is vegetation. Without plants, animals could not survive.
Mosasaurs were the most voracious predators of their time, so they had no fear whatsoever of other mosasaurs.
Its long teeth had more than 70 sharp points, as well as an extra jawbone in the mouth, which means nothing could escape its path.
It is uncertain, but it is possible it had two mouths. It was fed on large fish, other dinosaurs, and may have been a carnivore.
It attacks every type of water monster; even a giant T. Rex will not be immune to it.
Though many of their foods might seem strange to us, the Romans enjoy exotic dishes such as snails, peacocks, starlings and a special kind of dormouse.
Another difference is that while the poor and the woman would eat their meals in armchairs, rich men preferred to have meals together, where they would sit alongside each other while eating their meals.
The classical Roman diet could not have included foods from the Americas or Asia many centuries ago.
For example, they had no corn, or tomatoes, or potatoes, or cocoa, and none of the ancient Romans had ever tasted turkey.
The Babylonians built a temple to their god, known as the house of their god.
People would make offerings to the gods and priests would attempt to fulfill the deities' requirements through rituals and ceremonies.
Each temple has an open outer courtyard, with an inner sanctuary that is exclusively reserved for priests.
Occasionally, separate structures called ziggurats were built for membership in the church.
The top of the tower was the domain of an idol.
In the hot climate of the Middle East, the house was not vital.
Most of the Hebrew family's life occurred in the air.
Women cooked in the courtyards; stores displayed food on the streets. Stones were used to build houses.
And there are not many forests in the land of Canaan, so trees are very expensive.
According to the Norse sagas, Erik the Red was exiled to Iceland for killing, and on his journey westwards, he discovered Greenland and named it Greenland.
But despite these findings, the area was still inhabited by Eskimo tribes.
Although each country in the region called 'Scandinavia', there are many differences among the people, kings, customs, and history of Denmark, Sweden, Norway and Iceland.
If you have seen the movie National Treasure, you may think that the treasure map was written on the back of the Declaration of Independence.
However, it is not true. Although there is something written on the back of the page, it is not a treasure map.
The words "First Declaration of Independence 4 July 1776" are inscribed on the back of the Declaration of Independence.
While no one knows who wrote it, it is known that early in its history, a large leather document (measuring 29¾ by 24½ inches) was folded for safe-keeping.
Now, it is possible that the bribe is labelled as a cash deposit.
The D-Day landings and subsequent wars liberated the north of France, but the south was not liberated.
It was done by the Vichy French, who were Frenchmen that made peace with the Germans in 1940 and cooperated with the Allied invaders instead of being censured.
On August 15, 1940, the Allies invaded southern France in Operation Dragoon.
Within two weeks, American and French troops had liberated southern France and were heading for Germany.
Illumination is one tradition shared by a large number of individuals who live and work in a society.
The word civilization comes from the Latin word "civilis", which means "civil", associated with the Latin word "civis", meaning "citizen", and with "civitas", meaning "city" or "city-state", and in some ways describes the level of society.
Urban cities are hubs of ethnicity. Cultural civilization defines the passing of knowledge from generation to generation, the far reaches of cultural remainder and appropriate distribution.
Micro-cultures tend to disappear without leaving a good historical record and tend to be viewed as simply modern.
During the Revolutionary War, thirteen states began to create a weak federal government- with Congress being the only elected institution- under the Articles of Confederation.
The legislature had no authority to levy taxes, and for the same reason, the absence of national managers or judges has left it up to the governors, who on some occasions, without a union, have enforced all its laws.
And had no authority to bypass any tax or pricing laws among countries.
The Articles required explicit approval by all the provinces before they could be amended and the provinces had disregarded the central government to such a degree that their representatives were frequently absent.
The Italian national football team, along with the German national football team, is the second most successful national football team in the world and were the champions of the 2006 FIFA World Cup.
Popular sports include football, basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey and F1 motor racing.
Winter sports are popular in the North, as well as with the Italians during the World Cups and Olympics.
Japan has approximately 7,000 islands (the largest of which is Honshu), making Japan one of the largest island nations in the world.
Due to Japan's many islands, Japan is often referred to by geographers as an "archipelago".
The origin of Taiwan goes back to the 15th century when European explorers recorded the name of the island as Ilha Formosa, or the beautiful island.
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company set up a base on the southwestern tip of Taiwan, initiating a revolution in grain production and recruiting Chinese workers to work in the rice and sugar fields.
In 1683, the Qing dynasty (1644-1912) forces took control of the western and northern coastal areas, with Taiwan becoming a province of the Qing Empire in 1885.
In 1895, after the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Qing government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki, in which it ceded control of Taiwan to Japan, which retained control of the island until 1945.
Machu Picchu has three important sites, called the Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun, and the Three Windows hall.
Many of the building features along the complex have been constructed to give tourists a better idea of how they originally stood.
By 1976, approximately thirty percent of Machu Picchu had been restored, and the restoration continues to this day.
For example, the most common camera is the 35mm film, which was the dominant film size at the end of the analog film era.
It is done today, but what is important is that its ratio is taken by the digital camera image sensor format.
35mm film, known as 135 film, measures 36mm across and 24mm in height.
The format of this ratio (dividing by twelve to produce a simple whole-number ratio) is said to be 3:2.
Most popular formats (the APS family of formats, for example) give this figure or a rough estimate of it.
A commonly misused and often misreported law of the three-dimensional model is a simple guide for making geometric changes while maintaining balance in the image.
The most effective area for the lead subject is where the three lines separating a triangle from a right triangle meet (see example).
At this point in European history, the Roman Catholic Church, once rich and powerful, was viewed with suspicion.
Over thousands of years, Christianity united European nations despite differences in geography and language.
It is a divisive force that can be felt from king to squire.
One of the basic tenets of Christianity is that wealth is to be used to alleviate suffering and poverty, and church funds are specially meant to do just that.
The legal head of the church was Rome for over a millennium, and the pressure of money and power caused many to doubt that its constitution had been right.
Immediately after the outbreak of hostilities, Britain began closing off German waters with the use of their navy.
The strategy seemed to work, cutting off vital support from soldiers and settlers, even though the embargo violates a principle agreed upon in the international agreements of two centuries ago.
Britain had dug up territorial waters to prevent ships from approaching the open seas, damaging innocent vessels.
With no viable alternative to the plan, Germany expected a similar response from its unrestricted naval operations.
During the 1920s, the prevailing attitude of citizens and nations was one of peace-loving neutrality.
After experiencing the horrors and atrocities of war during World War I, nations have expressed their desire to avert such events in the future.
In 1884, Tesla moved to the United States to work for the Edison Company in New York City.
He arrived in the US with 4 cents to his name, a book of poems, and a recommendation letter from Charles Batchelor (his boss at his previous job) to Thomas Edison.
Ancient China had a unique way of depicting the various eras; each Chinese dynasty or ruling family was a separate classification.
Among each dynasty, there were also years of various provincial instabilities, the most notorious of these times being the Three Kingdoms epoch over the 60-year span between the Han and Jin Dynasties.
During these times, a vicious royal battle for the throne raged among the nobility.
The Three Kingdoms period witnessed one of the worst periods of bloodshed in the history of Ancient China, when many people were killed competing for high-ranking court positions in the Upper Court at Xi'an.
There have been many social and political implications such as the adoption of the metric system, the change from absolutism to republicanism and nationalism, and the belief that a country is for its people and not just its rulers.
And after the Revolution workshop was open to all applicants, allowing even the most successful and award-winning to succeed.
The same applies to the military because instead of being based on class, it is now based on caliber.
The revolution in France has also encouraged many other oppressed foreign workers to start their own revolutions.
Muhammad was deeply interested in matters beyond everyday life. He would often go to a cave known as "Hira'" in the "Noor" (meaning light) mountain for meditation.
The veil has survived all these seasons, giving a vivid picture of Muhammad's spiritual inclinations.
Lying atop the northern mountains of Mecca, the cave is isolated from the rest of the world.
Furthermore, it is not difficult to know whether someone is aware that it exists. Just enter the cave, be by yourself.
There is nothing to see but the pure, beautiful clouds above and many surrounding mountains. Few traces of the planet are ever seen or heard from within the caves.
The Great Pyramid of Giza is the only one still standing among the Seven Wonders of the ancient world.
The Great Pyramid was constructed by the Egyptians in the third dynasty, and is one of the greatest monuments built to honor a deceased pharaoh.
The Giza Plateau, also known as the "Giza Necropolis," is a region in Egypt that contains several pyramids, including the largest one, as well as numerous tombs, temples, and the great Sphinx.
The largest pyramid was built in honor of Pharaoh Khufu, and a number of smaller ones, tombs, and temples were built to honor Khufu's wives and family members.
This symbol is an up bow, which is shaped like a V, and the down bow is shaped like a u facing downwards or an incomplete square on the lower side.
"To rise means that you must start at the bottom and pull the bowstring up, and to lower means that you must start from the grip (where your hand holds the bowstring) and release the bowstring."
"A bow pointed upward often produces a gentle, even low tone, while a bow pointed downward is more forceful and dynamic."
Feel free to put down your pencil notes, but keep in mind that printed notations for bending exist for musical purposes and should be respected.
On October 6th, 1789, King Louis XVI, Queen Marie Antoinette, their two children (11-year-old Marie Therese and 4-year-old Louis-Charles), and the King's sister, Madam Elizabeth, were forced to return to Paris from Versailles at the insistence of the people.
They fled back to Paris from the chalet, surrounded by a mob calling out all sorts of threats against the King and Queen.
The crowd forced the King and Queen to open the airplane windows.
A member of the aristocracy once presented the severed head of a royal bodyguard who was killed at Versailles before the frightened empress.
The costs of the U.S.'s fight against imperialism in the Philippines were paid for by the Filipino people themselves.
They were forced to pay taxes to the US colonial authorities to meet tremendous expenditure and bond revenues on behalf of the Filipino government to the Wall Street housing banks.
The extravagant profits from exploiting the Filipino people make a fortune for U.S. imperialism.
In order to be requested by the Templars, one must first be in a situation that led to the formation of the Order.
The period during which events took place is typically referred to as the Middle Ages, the time in European history during the 11th, 12th, and 13th centuries (AD 1000-1300).
The High Middle Ages were preceded by the Early Middle Ages and followed by the Late Middle Ages, usually ending about 1500.
Technological determinism is a term that encompasses a wide range of meanings in everyday life, from technological progress or the significance of technology to the fundamental assumption that humanity's future is determined by the laws of science and their manifestation through technology.
Most cases of technological determinism fall into two categories: that technological development itself follows a path that is more cultural or politically aesthetic, and that technology also has 'effects' on independent nations, rather than on the socially dominated.
For example, one might say that the automobile leads to improved roads.
However, road connections are not a solution due to the scarcity of vehicles, therefore new development methods must be implemented to reduce the cost of vehicle ownership.
Having more vehicles leads to an increase in the chances of road accidents, resulting in the need for new health care proposals to take care of injuries and physical therapy.
Romanticism had a strong sense of cultural expression, drawn from authors such as Goethe, Fichte, and Schlegel.
In the case of Romanism, geography shaped people, and over time rituals and culture associated with that geography arose, and these, in harmony with a social setting, were much better than fixed laws.
In this way, Paris became known as the fashion capital of the modern world, while Constantinople was considered the fashion capital of ancient Europe.
Its prominence as an epicenter of wealth began around 400 A.D. and continued until about 1100 A.D.
Its decline during the 12th century was mainly attributable to travelers who returned with gifts like silk, and spices valued far above supply in the Byzantine market.
That was also when the title of Fashion Capital was taken from Constantinople to Paris.
Gothic style emerged during the mid-10th to 11th and 14th centuries.
Initially, it was heavily influenced by Eastern Byzantine culture.
However, because of the slow pace of communications, western styles would be 25 to 30 years behind.
In the later medieval period, Western Europe began to develop its own style. The major progress of this era came in the form of the crusades, in which people started to use buttons to tighten their clothing.
Sustainable farming is a practice aimed at producing enough food to meet the needs of the farmer and their household.
Organic farming is simple, often using fertilizers and a locally sourced seed system that, combined with vegetative or other types of crop rotation, increases production.
Historically, the majority of farmers engaged in subsistence agriculture, and this is still the case in many developing countries.
Subcultures bring together like-minded people who feel neglected by public norms and allow them to develop a sense of identity.
Microculture may vary due to the age, ethnicity, class, locality, and/or sex of the members.
Characteristics identifying a distinct culture such as language, appearance, religion, politics, sexuality, locality, or a combination of other features.
Members of a culture often express their identity through distinct and symbolic use of style, including fashion, behavior, and attire.
One common way to illustrate the value of human contact is to take a few examples of situations where children were ignored, exposed to tragedy, or deliberately abused and isolated by society during a particularly turbulent childhood.
These children are known as "feral" or wild. Some children of this type were locked away by people (usually their parents); In some instances, the abandonment of the child was due to parental rejection of severe mental or physical disability.
Abused children may have been subjected to more abuse prior to being abandoned or running away.
Some are believed to have been raised by animals; others are said to have lived alone in the wild.
When raised by non-human animals, a child will exhibit behaviors (and innate characteristics) similar to its caregiver, such as phobias and prejudice towards people.
Whereas project-focused learning should make learning easier and more interesting, the Scaffolding Stage takes this a step further.
Scaffolding is not a learning method, but rather a support structure that provides assistance to individuals learning new subjects such as using a computer program or starting a new job.
Scaffolds can both look real and be real; in other words, the teacher is a sort of scaffold, but so too is the paperclip character in Microsoft Office.
It is a visual scaffold that is internally embedded within software and is intended to ask questions, speed up, and clarify processes which can be challenging for the student to manage alone.
Children are put into Child Support for a variety of reasons ranging from neglect, abuse, and poverty.
No child should grow up in an uncaring, undeveloped, and uneducated place, but it happens.
We see the Children's Program as a haven for these children.
Our child care program must provide safe homes, loving caregivers, quality education, and dependable healthcare.
Foster care should provide for everything that the former adoptive home lacked.
The Internet connects both things and communication between people.
The defining characteristics of the internet structure lead to different levels of usage and content satisfaction.
For example, "learning" and "connecting with others" are suggested as important reasons for Internet use (James et al., 1995).
"Commitment" and "continuous relationships" were identified as the two new motivators by Eighmey and McCord (1998) when they surveyed audience responses to websites.
The use of video and audio recording allowed for important discoveries in understanding subtle changes in facial expressions, fleeting facial movements that last only a few seconds.
Specifically, it is said that lying can be detected through a skill called facial interpretation.
In his essay The President's Speech, Oliver Sacks pointed out that people who have difficulty understanding speech due to traumatic brain injury can still reach the truth precisely.
She even suggested that an adaptation of our moods could possibly be developed in domestic animals such as dogs.
20th century research has revealed two pockets of genetic variation: hidden and manifest.
Mutation increases genetic diversity, while selection removes it from the pool of observable variations.
Segmentation and merging change the size and composition of clusters back and forth between the age grouping.
In a flat area, it would be difficult for an individual to meet their amino-acid requirements using the existing plants.
Furthermore, doing so results in negative consequences: increased stress, malnutrition, and eventually death.
These things are easily available as plant-based protein found in leaves and legumes, but it is difficult for people who eat them to digest them without being cooked.
On the other hand, the animal's diet (ants, ducks, eggs) is easily broken down, and there are high-grade curative proteins that contain all the amino acids.
Considering all that has been presented, we should not be surprised that our ancestors solved their "protein problem" in much the same way as desert tortoises do today.
A sleep disturbance is when you wake up during your normal sleep time and fall back to sleep quickly within 10-60 minutes.
This can be done easily by using a silent alarm clock to bring you to your senses without fully waking you up.
If you find that you automatically switch off the alarm when it wakes you up, it may be moved to the other side of the room, forcing you to get out of bed to turn it off.
Some biorhythm-based options include drinking more water (especially water or tea, known simply as a diuretic) before bedtime, forcing someone to get up to pee.
A person's degree of peace is based on their level of mental and physical anxiety.
The less stress you have, the more energy there is to live. Everyone can find complete peace and satisfaction.
Anyone can achieve enlightenment. The only things that stand in our way are our self-control and lack of self-trust.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of Buddha, but is enhanced by the Mahayana way of love and many methods derived from Indian Yoga.
At its core, Tibetan Buddhism is quite simple. It includes Kundalini Yoga, meditation, and the Way of Unconditional Love.
In Kundalini Yoga, the Kundalini force (the energy of light) is awakened through yoga postures, breathing exercises, mantras, and visualization.
The focus of Tibetan meditation is Divine Yoga. Through the perspective of various deities, the energy channels are cleansed, the chakras are activated, and the knowledge of enlightenment is gained.
During World War II, Germany was the enemy of many, leading to the alliance between the Soviet Union and America. At the end of the war, tensions over institutions, policies, and customs led to the division of the two nations.
Two years after the end of the war, former allies became enemies and the Cold War began.
It was stored for the next 40 years and claimed by armies in conflicts from Africa to Asia, Afghanistan, Cuba, and elsewhere.
By September 17, 1939, the Polish army had been crushed, and the only hope was to retreat, making adjustments along the Romanian border.
However, these plans were disrupted almost overnight, when over 800,000 troops from the Soviet Union Red Army entered and created the Belarussian-Ukrainian border after invading Poland's eastern regions against the Riga Peace Treaty, the Soviet-Polish Non-Aggression Pact, and other international agreements, both bilateral and multilateral.
Using a cargo ship to transport goods is an efficient way of moving large numbers of people and cargo to reduce congestion on the coasts.
The traditional role of a navy was to ensure that your country maintained its ability to move people and goods, while at the same time interfering with your enemy's ability to move people and goods.
One of the most notable examples was the North Atlantic campaign of WWII. The Americans shipped men and armaments across the Atlantic Ocean to assist Britain.
Meanwhile, the German navy, using mostly U-boats, tried to intercept the convoy.
If the Allies had not been victorious, Germany could have subjugated Britain because the rest of Europe was within its grasp.
It appears that goats were domesticated as long as 10,000 years ago in the Zagros Mountains of Iran.
Ancient cultures and tribes began to preserve them for easier access to milk, hair, meat, and hides.
Domesticated goats were bred in herds that would roam freely over hills or open fields, under the shepherding care of their owners who, like the more famous shepherds, were usually young. Payment methods are still highly regulated today.
Coach roads were constructed in England for the first time in the 16th century.
Although the carts had wooden boards placed sideways, they allowed horses to pull them at higher speeds and with heavier loads than if they had traveled on those difficult roads of the day.
Crossties were quickly introduced to hold the tracks in place. However, it was realized that the tracks could be more efficient if they were carrying metal surfaces.
This was a common occurrence, but the iron caused wear on the carriage wheels.
Finally, wooden rails were replaced by iron rails. In 1767, the first iron rails were produced.
The first mode of movement was walking, with humans starting to walk upright about two million years ago with the emergence of Homo Erectus (meaning upright man).
Unlike its predecessors, the Australopithecus did not walk upright as a species.
Bipedal specialization has been discovered in the fossils of Australopithecus from 4.2-3.9 million years ago, although Sahelanthropus may have walked on two legs as recently as 7 million years ago.
We can start living more environmentally friendly, join an environmental movement, and even become activists to lessen the suffering it brings to some extent.
This is like plugging holes in many dikes. However, if we are not looking for an overnight solution, we must look for the causes so we can tackle them.
Clearly, the world has changed greatly due to advances in science and technology, and the problems of the increasingly populous world and human excesses have gotten worse.
After being passed by Congress on July 4, a handwritten draft was signed by President of Congress John Hancock and Secretary Charles Thomson and sent to the printers at the nearby shop of John Dunlap.
At night, between 150 and 200 copies were made, now known as the "Dunlap broadsides."
The first reading of the document was by John Nixon in the Independence Hall garden on July 8th.
One was sent to George Washington on July 6th, to be read to his troops in New York on July 9th. A copy arrived in London on August 10th.
25 Dunlap is known to be among the oldest surviving copies of the manuscript. The first hand-written copy was not destroyed.
Most paleontologists today believe that only one group of dinosaurs, called birds, survived and is still alive.
Many people do not consider dinosaurs because they have feathers and can fly.
But there are many things about birds that resemble dinosaurs.
They have hoofs and claws, lay eggs, and walk on their two hind legs just like a T-Rex.
Almost all computers in modern use rely on using information stored in the form of binary numbers.
A binary number consists of two digits - 0 or 1 - and these are called binary digits or bits in the computer programming language.
The underlying toxins may not be visible immediately. Symptoms, such as vomiting, are so common as to not be considered pathogenic.
A common cause of indoor pollution is the presence of containers of paints or household chemicals that are dangerous.
Look at the first-aid instructions on the label for information about specific toxins.
Photographers later replaced an old woman as she searched for the toilet. Mendoza was brought down.
This term has long been associated with bed bugs, which are insects that can bite people.
Both Assassin-bugs and Bed-bugs are non-venomous, naturally adapted to live in either cages or in the homes of their owners.
In the United States of America, it is estimated that around 400,000 individuals have Multiple Sclerosis (MS), making it the leading neurological disorder among young and middle-aged adults.
MS is a disease that affects the central nervous system, made up of the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerve.
Research has found that women are twice as likely to be diagnosed with MS than men.
A couple may decide that they are not fit, or may think of their child, to raise him/her.
The couple may choose to set up child adoption proceedings.
When a child is placed in foster care, the biological parents give up their parental rights so that another couple can become the parents of that child.
The primary goal of science is to discover how the world operates scientifically. This goal guides much scientific inquiry.
Not just a guess, an experiment is a test used to eliminate one or more conjectures, raise questions, and carry out observations that inform scientific inquiry.
Naturalists and philosophers focused on ancient writings, particularly on the Latin Bible.
Aristotle's viewpoints were welcomed in all areas of science, including psychology.
As Greek knowledge declined, Westerners found themselves at odds with their Greek thinkers and their scientific roots.
Many notice the differences in appearance and form that mainly depend on the availability of endogenous cycles and their development during the natural ordering of things.
Periodic rhythms, more than simply responses to external seasonal factors, have already been recorded in many species, including bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals.
Biological clocks build internal oscillators that continue to cycle freely even without external input.
The Hershey and Chase experiments are one of the main pieces of evidence suggesting that DNA is inherited.
Hershey and Chase used phages, or viruses, to insert their own DNA into the virus.
They performed two labeling tests, either using radioactive phosphorus to label DNA or using sulfur to label the phage protein.
Mutations can have a variety of effects depending on the type of mutation, the importance of the affected gene and whether the involved cells are germline cells.
Only changes in the virus's cell lines can be passed on to children, while changes elsewhere can cause cell death or cancer.
Nature-based tourism appeals to people who are interested in exploring nature, including plants and wildlife.
Examples of activities at the site include hiking, fishing, photography, bird watching, park visits, and learning about nature.
Examples include visiting, taking photographs and learning about the organgatuangs in Orneo.
Every morning, people leave their villages by car to go to work, and pass by their colleagues who are also heading to work.
In this flexible shuttle, everyone is connected in one way or another, and supports the transportation system established by private cars.
Science now shows that the carbon economy has plummeted into the biosphere from one of its stable states that supported human evolution for the past two billion years.
Everyone takes part in society and uses transportation systems. In fact, almost everyone complains about transportation systems.
In developed countries, the same complaints about the low quality of water and crumbling bridges are occasionally heard.
Why do transportation systems cause such complaints, why do they fail every day? Do the transportation engineers not work? Or is there something more important going on?
Motor logistics is the study of the movement of individual drivers and vehicles from one place to another and their interactions with each other.
Unfortunately, studying the flow of traffic is difficult because a driver's behavior cannot be accurately imitated.
Fortunately, drivers generally behave well within the ideal range; whereas, trajectories tend to have optimal consistency and can be represented mathematically.
To be a better representation of traffic flow, relationships have been established between the three main characteristics: (1) flow, (2) density, and (3) velocity.
This network of relationships helps in planning, designing and maintaining roads.
Insects were the first animals to fly. Their ability to fly has helped them escape predators easily and find food more efficiently.
Many insects have the ability to fold their wings onto the underside of their bodies.
This provides many small hiding places for some animals.
These days, among the insects that are unable to fold their wings are flies and mosquitoes.
Thousands of years ago, a man named Aristarchus proposed that the Solar System orbited the Sun.
Some people thought he was right, but the majority believed the opposite; that the Solar System revolves around the Earth, including the sun and other stars.
"It appears conscious, because the Earth is not still, do you hear it?"
The Amazon River is the second-longest and largest river in the world. It holds more than eight times the water volume of the world's second-largest river.
The Amazon is the largest river in the world, in some places it is more than six miles wide.
20 percent of the total water that runs from rivers worldwide to the oceans originates in the Amazon.
The Amazon River is 6,387 km (3,980 miles) long and draws water from thousands of streams.
Although pyramid building with stone continued until the end of the Old Kingdom, the scale and sophistication of the construction techniques used in the Giza pyramids were unparalleled.
The young kingdoms of ancient Egypt were amazed by their old monuments, which were over a thousand years old.
Vatican City, home to around 800 people, is the smallest independent nation in the world.
Vatican City uses Italian for administration and official correspondence.
Italian became a lingua franca once again, with Latin being the language used for religious services.
All the residents of Vatican City are Roman Catholics.
Humans have known about basic chemicals such as gold, silver, and copper for quite some time as all can be obtained in nature by natural processes and are much easier to obtain with old tools.
The philosopher Aristotle taught that the universe is composed of one or more of four basic elements: earth, water, air, and fire.
This was in keeping with the four states of matter (in the same order): solid, liquid, gas, and plasma, though he thought they transmuted into new substances to create what we see.
Alloys are a mixture of two or more metals. Don't forget that there are many elements in the periodic table.
Elements such as calcium and potassium are considered minerals. Yes, there are also minerals such as silver and gold.
It is also possible to obtain alloys that contain small amounts of non-metallic elements such as carbon.
Everything on Earth is made of matter, matter that is composed of tiny particles called atoms.
Atoms are so tiny that many trillions of them combine to form the punctuation marks at the end of sentences.
So, for many people, the pencil became a newfound friend.
Sadly, as new forms of writing have emerged, the use of pencils has been relegated to less prominent and less utilized applications.
People are now writing messages on computer screens, without ever having to approach the mailbox.
One may wonder what a keyboard will be like when there is something new.
A fission bomb works on the principle that it takes energy to drive a nucleus with a large number of protons and neutrons to convergence.
It is like pushing a trolley up a hill. Splitting the nucleus releases some of its energy.
Some atoms have an unstable nucleus, which means that they tend to decay without much provocation or none at all.
The surface of the Moon is made of rocks and dust, and its outer layer is known as the crust.
The land slopes down by 70 km and descends 100 km in the farthest direction.
The bottom is lean under the bridges and is fat in elevated areas.
There can also be additional maria on the closer side because the layer is thinner. It is easy for the lava to rise to the surface.
Content theories tend to identify the one thing that causes people to brand or appeal to them.
These theories suggest that people have certain needs or desires that have been kept bottled up as they get older.
This theory examines what motivates certain individuals to do the things they do and what specific characteristics of the environment they live in influence their behavior.
Two well-known theories are Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs Theory and Herzberg's Two Factor Theory.
In general, two types of behavior can emerge as managers start to lead their former peers. One tries to remain "one of the boys" (or girls).
This type of supervisor has difficulty making unpopular decisions, enacting disciplinary measures, evaluating performance, assigning responsibility, and holding people accountable.
On the other hand, a person changes into an unknown individual who thinks that they should change everything that was previously done by the group and do it their way.
Ultimately, a leader is often responsible for the success or failure of their team.
This is a practice that tends to create tension between the leadership and the group at large.
Teams working on the Internet must meet the same level of standards as those that are accustomed to, but there is a slight difference.
The appropriate members of the group consistently act as a point of contact for their team-body.
They enjoy more autonomy than the members of a more regular group since their groups may meet at different times without being noticed by their community leaders.
The existence of a true "invisible" class (Larson and LaFasto, 1989, p109) is also a uniqueness of the visible class.
"The invisible team" is a governing body where officers report to it. The invisible team sets the standard for each officer.
Why would an organization want to go through the process of mocking another organization? One purpose for setting up organizational learning contracts is to prevent this.
When all equipment is properly used by all levels of the organization, professionalism and reliability can be evident.
As a result, a collaborative approach to overcoming an obstacle can lead to a new approach to serving the needs of the customer.
Before a company can innovate, management must cultivate a culture of innovation and knowledge-sharing, including learning for itself.
Angel (2006) defines the Proactivity approach as a methodology to help organizations reach high performance.
Neurobiology data provides concrete evidence for theories about the brain. Therefore, it narrows down research to a more specific case.
The link between brain pathology and habits supports scientists in research.
It has been known for a long time that various forms of brain injury, trauma, acquired injuries, and traumatic lesions have a direct impact on behavior and also produce changes in some functions of the brain.
The rise of modern technology has made it possible to survey and study brain structures and systems that had never been seen before.
This provides us with abundant information and tools to create models that help us understand what is happening in our minds.
Although AI has a non-scientific dimension, AI creates an essential foundation in the field of computer science, dealing with patterns, learning, and artificial intelligence.
The research on AI involves making machines that automate tasks requiring intelligent behavior.
Examples include control, planning and scheduling, the ability to respond to customer mistakes and questions, the ability to see who had written with their hand, and identifying the voice and face.
Such things fall into different categories and are geared towards providing solutions to real life problems.
The AI system is now commonly used in areas of economics, medicine, engineering, and the military, as it has already been built into computer software and video game applications.
Educational trips are an important part of any class. Often, the teacher takes his students to places where transportation by bus is not feasible.
Technology provides a solution to a virtual field trip. Students may look at archaeological objects, visit an aquarium, or see beautiful artwork while sitting in their classroom.
Traveling is almost another way to see the world and exchange ideas with students for the future.
For example, every year students from the Bennett School in North Carolina create a website about their trip to the State Capital, and each year the website is updated, but older versions are preserved online for use as a scrapbook.
Blogs can help improve students' writing. Although students often report blog experiences with spelling errors and their inability to write accurately, if people can read them, this will usually make a difference.
Since readers are often a comment-free audience, the blogger often begins to write to improve their writing style in an attempt to avoid criticism.
Blogging also "forces students to become more informed about the world around them." The need to feed audience interest encourages students to be intelligent and curious (Toto, 2004).
Blogging is a tool that encourages collaboration, and it empowers students to extend their learning beyond the traditional school curriculum.
The effective use of blogs "can equip students to become more analytical and critical; by actively responding to Internet resources, students can express their position on the literary status of others and express their own opinions on issues" (Oravec, 2002).
Ottawa is Canada's beautiful capital city, home to a community that speaks two or more languages, and numerous galleries and museums that showcase Canada's history and modern-day culture.
In the far south is Niagara Falls and to the north is home to untouched natural beauty in Muskoka and beyond.
All of these and other things show Ontario as a typical place in Canada.
Large powerful areas have few inhabitants and some are still uninhabited.
A population comparison that surprises many: There are more African Americans living in the US than in Canada.
The East African Archipelago is located in the Indian Ocean off the east coast of Africa.
Madagascar is the largest, and in terms of wildlife, the only continent that can be reached by land.
Many of the smaller islands are either independent nations or associated with France, known for their high-quality seaside recreation.
The Arabs also brought Islam to the countries, and it took a major hold in the Comoros and Mayotte.
European influence and colonization began in the 15th century, when Portuguese explorer Vaco da Gama discovered the Cape route from Europe to India.
In the north, the region borders the Sahel, and in the south and west, it is the Atlantic Ocean.
Women: It is advised that visiting women identify themselves as married, regardless of whether they are married or not.
It also helps to wear a ring, but not one that looks too flashy.
Women need to be aware that cultural differences can lead to what they perceive as abuse and it is not normal to be followed, held by the hand, etc.
Be sure to gather the men, and don't be afraid to take your stand (cultural differences or not, it doesn't make it right!).
Today's city of Casablanca was founded by Berber fishermen in the 10th century BCE, and was used by the Phoenicians, Romans, and Merenids as a port called Anfa.
The Portuguese destroyed and rebuilt it under the name Casa Branca, but abandoned it again following an earthquake in 1755.
The Sultan of Morocco rebuilt the city as Daru Badya, and it was given the name Casablanca by Spanish architects who had established trade posts there.
Casablanca is one of the most fascinating shopping areas in Morocco.
In the old Medina, it is easy to find marketplaces that sell traditional Moroccan items such as capes, pottery, leather goods, hookahs, and entire geegaws, but all for tourists.
Goma is a popular tourist destination in the Democratic Republic of Congo, located in the east near the border with Rwanda.
In 2002, Goma was devastated by a massive lava flow from the Nyiragongo volcano that buried most of the city's streets, particularly the city center.
While Goma is reasonably secure, all travel outside of Goma must be screened to understand the nature of the ongoing conflict in the North Kivu province.
This city was the starting point for the eruption of the Nyiragongo Volcano, as well as other mountains that are not too expensive to climb, known as the African Gorillas.
You may use a boda-boda (motorcycle taxi) to get to places in Goma. The usual (local) price is 500 Congolese Francs for a short journey.
Coupled with its inaccessibility, "Timbuktu" has been used as a metaphor for faraway lands, far away.
Today, Timbuktu is a poor town, although its name makes it a tourist attraction, and it even has an airport.
In 1990, it was placed on the list of world heritage sites in danger due to the harsh desert sands.
It was one of the top stops for Henry Louis Gates' PBS program Special Wonders of the African World.
This city clashes with the rest of the country, since it is almost wholly Arab rather than African.
Kruger National Park (KNP) is located in the northeastern part of South Africa and is bordered by Mozambique to the east, Zimbabwe to the north, and the Crocodile River to the south.
"The park covers 19,500 km² and is divided into 14 ecozones, each supporting a diverse range of wildlife."
"It is one of the most visited attractions in South Africa and is considered to be the centerpiece of South Africa's National Parks (SANParks)."
Like all other South African national parks, there are preserves and a fee to enter the park.
It is beneficial for a person to purchase a Wild Card, which allows access to certain reserves in South Africa or to all South African State Parks.
Hong Kong Island gives the territory of Hong Kong its name and is considered by many as a major tourist attraction.
The vast array of buildings that make up the skyline of Hong Kong is likened to a glittering bar chart created by the presence of Victoria Harbor's waters.
For a better view of Hong Kong, leave the island and go to the Kowloon waterfront directly in front of it.
Most of the urban development on Hong Kong Island has been undertaken on land that was once the northern sea.
This is a place taken by the British colonials, and if you want evidence of the territory's past, this is a good place to start.
The Sundarbans is the largest mangrove area in the world, extending 80 km (50 miles) inland from the coast of Bangladesh and India.
The Sundarbans has been declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site. A part of the forest within India is known as the Sundarbans National Park.
The rainforests are not just mangrove swamps, but they include the last remnants of the enormous woods that once covered the Gangetic plain.
The Sundarbans covers an area of about 3850 km², of which about a third is covered in water/marsh areas.
Since 1966, the Sundarbans has been a wildlife sanctuary, and it is currently home to an estimated 400 Royal Bengal tigers and 30,000 spotted deer in the wild.
Buses leave the inter-district station (across the river) throughout the day, although some, mainly the easterly ones and those to Jakar/Bumthang, run between 06:30 and 07:30.
As local buses are always full, it is advisable to buy a ticket in advance.
Much of the countryside is served by Japanese Coaster minibuses, which are in excellent and good condition.
Shared taxis are a fast and enjoyable way to travel to nearby places, such as Paro (Nu150) and Punakha (Nu200).
The Oyapock River Bridge is a cable bridge that crosses the Oyapock River, connecting the cities of Oiapoque in Brazil to Saint-Georges de l'Oyapock in French Guiana.
The two tall buildings rise to a height of 83 meters, and are 378 meters long with two roads that are 3.50 meters wide.
The flat recess underneath the bridge is 15 meters. Construction was completed in August 2011 but it was not opened to traffic until March 2017.
The bridge is scheduled to be fully operational by September 2017, when the Brazilian customs checkpoint is expected to be completed.
The Guarani were the dominant indigenous group living in what is now Eastern Paraguay, who subsisted by hunting and farming.
The Chaco region was home to indigenous tribal groups such as the Guaycurú and Payaguá, who made their living by hunting, harvesting, and fishing.
In the 16th century, Paraguay, once called "The Giant Province of the Indies", was formed due to invasions by both Spanish conquistadors and native groups.
The Spanish began a three-century-long colonial period.
Since its founding in Asunción in 1537, Paraguay has been able to preserve its heritage.
Argentina is known for having some of the best polo teams and players in the world.
The biggest polo tournament of the year is held in December at Las Cañitas.
Small tournaments and plays can also be viewed at other times of the year.
For news on tournaments and where to buy tickets for polo matches, check out the Argentine Polo Association.
The official currency of the Falkland Islands is the Falkland pound (FKP), which is pegged to the British pound (GBP).
Money can be exchanged at the only bank on the island chain located in Stanley, across from the FIC West store.
British pound notes will be widely accepted throughout the islands and within Stanley credit cards and US dollars are usually accepted.
Foreign currency may not be accepted in the outer islands, but British and American currency is accepted; check with shippers before arrival to determine the appropriate means of payment.
It is nearly impossible to change money in the Falklands if you are not on the island, so change your currency before leaving.
Because Montevideo is located just south of the Equator, its seasons alternate with those of the Northern Hemisphere, where it is summer there when it is winter here.
Montevideo is in a hot zone; during summer months, temperatures above 30°C are common.
Winter can be cold: temperatures rarely fall below freezing, but the combination of air and humidity can make it feel cooler than what the thermometer indicates.
There are no "wet" and "dry" seasons: the amount of rainfall remains constant throughout the year.
Although many animals in the park are used to seeing people, their natural habitat should not be disturbed.
According to park officials, stay at least 100 yards from bears and wolves and 25 yards from all other wildlife!
Regardless of how they look, buffalo, elk, moose, bears, and almost any large animal can attack you.
Every year, tourists suffer because they don't keep a safe distance. These animals are large, aggressive, and dangerous, so give them their space.
Additionally, be aware that the smell may attract bears and other wildlife, so take precautions when handling or cooking food and keep the camp clean.
Apia is the capital of Samoa, and the city's population is just under 40,000, found on the island of Upolu.
Apia was founded in the 1850s and has been the official capital of Samoa since 1959.
The harbor was a naval base in 1889 when seven ships from Germany, the US, and Britain refused to leave the port.
All but one of the British ships sank, and nearly 200 Americans and Germans lost their lives.
During the liberation demonstration organized by the Mau movement, the peaceful union that met in the town ended with the assassination of Chief Topua Tamasese Leaof III.
Auckland, which sits between two harbors, has well-developed beaches for swimming. Three of the city's most famous sites are located in a triangle of land.
The North Shore (the North Harbour region) stretches along the Pacific Ocean from Long Bay in the north to Devonport in the south.
All of these oceans have sandy, safe surfaces for swimming. They also have shade provided by trees along the coastline.
The beach at Tamaki Drive is located in the Port of Waitermata, in the suburbs of Mission Bay and St Helliers, as well as St Heliers in Central Auckland.
Beaches are sometimes crowded with families and have various shops along the shore. Swimming is safe.
The local liquor "Takes the first place", it is not strong, but sweet and refreshing. Another local liquor is called "Manta".
There are many wines available, but New Zealand and Australian wines can be the best.
The tap water in the local area is safe to drink, but if you're worried, bottled water is readily available.
Australians are not familiar with the term 'white coffee'. A short black is an 'espresso', cappuccino is topped with cream (not froth), and tea is served without milk.
The hot chocolate is of Belgian standards. The ingredients are expensive but delicious.
There is a yearly cruise to the ice-free ocean, and it is rare for sea ice to be lost in this area.
Comply with the authorities' instructions, obey all directions, and heed safety warnings.
Box jellyfish are abundant in coastal and estuary waters from October through April north of 1770. Sometimes they may be found in other seasons.
Sharks are present, but they rarely attack people. Most sharks are actually scared of people and tend to swim away from them.
The sea crocodile lives in small and secluded communities of fresh water, mostly in river bays north of Rockhampton.
Booking early gives passengers peace of mind that they will have a place to stay once they arrive at their destination.
Tour operators have contracts with some hotels, and it is possible to make reservations for other types of accommodations, such as camping, through travel agents.
Travel agencies usually offer packages that include breakfast, transportation arrangements to/from the airport or an integrated plane ride, and a hotel package.
They can also hold your reservation if you need time to think about the gift or to try other travel documents (such as your visa).
Any changes or requests should be directed to the travel agent, not directly to the hotel.
At other music festivals, many festival-goers have also decided to camp on the grounds of the event and many view it as a major part of their experience.
If you want to be close to the excitement, you'll need to arrive early and find a campsite near the action.
Remember that even though the music played on the main stage may have ended, there may still be sections of the festival that continue to play music late into the night.
Some festivals have campsites specifically designed for families with young children.
If you are going to travel to the North Baltic in winter, be on guard, as traveling in a boat can cause dangerous noises for those involved.
The tour of Saint Petersburg will include time in the city, which is exempt from visitor visa requirements (see regulations).
Casinos make a concerted effort to use tourist time and money wisely. Entertainment and shopping are not readily available and it is difficult to find exits.
They provide unique food, drinks, and entertainment, keep guests in a good mood and show hospitality in their halls.
Some places offer free alcohol. However, overindulgence can impair a person's ability to make sound decisions, so those who are skilled at gambling understand the importance of not getting drunk.
Anyone planning on driving over high altitudes or traveling through mountains needs to consider the availability of snow, ice, and frosty temperatures.
On icy, snow-covered roads, there is less traction, making it more dangerous to drive as if on clear roads.
In a freezing windstorm, enough snow to bring you through can fall in a very short time.
Visibility may not be good due to snow or hail, or even moisture or ice on car windows.
On the other hand, snow and ice are a familiar sight in many regions and traffic routes operate normally year-round without disruption.
Safari is perhaps the biggest tourist attraction in Africa, drawing in many visitors.
The term safari refers to traveling inland to view the spectacular African wildlife, especially in the savanna.
Other animals, such as elephants and wildebeests, tend to come very close to cars and can see better with special lookout equipment.
Lions, tigers, and leopards are generally shy and will be more comfortable with humpbacks.
A walking safari (also called a bush walk, hiking safari, or on-foot safari) involves traveling long distances, perhaps for a few hours or several days.
The Paralympics are set to start from the 24th of August to the 5th of September, 2021. Some events will be held in other locations in Japan.
Tokyo will be the only Asian city to have hosted the Olympics twice, having previously hosted the games in 1964.
If you booked a flight and accommodation for 2020 before the cancellation was announced, you may experience an uncertain situation.
"Cancellation policies vary, but as of the end of March, cancellations due to the coronavirus were limited to July 2020, when the Olympics were set to take place."
Multiple tickets are expected to cost between ¥2,500 and ¥130,000, with standard prices expected to be around ¥7,000.
Ironing clothes can help smooth them out. Hotels usually have an iron and ironing board that you can borrow, even if there is none in your room.
If a castor is not available, or you do not like to wear a castored sock, consider using a hairdryer, if available.
Be careful not to leave the fabric on too high of heat (which may cause wrinkles, or even burns).
There are many methods of purifying water, some quite effective at removing the glaringly obvious impurities.
In some places, boiling water for a minute is enough, while in others it is necessary to boil it for several minutes.
Filters vary in function, and if you cannot discern, you should consider buying your own bottled water from a trusted company.
Farmers may encounter insects from animals that are unknown in their neighborhoods.
Insects can spoil food, cause discomfort, provoke allergies in severe cases, increase venom, or spread infection.
Epidemics do not include contagious diseases or animals that can cause injury or death, also known as plagues.
Duty-free shopping is an opportunity to buy goods without paying taxes, and is available in certain locations.
Travelers heading to countries with high taxes may save a large amount of money at times, especially on items such as alcohol or tobacco.
The extended stretch between Point Marion and Fairmont provides one of the most challenging driving conditions on the Buffalo-Pittsburgh Highway, which often passes through timber landscapes.
If you are not used to driving in rural areas, be alert: steep, narrow, and winding roads.
The posted speed limits are noticeably slower than before and some sections are mainly at 35 to 40 mph (56 to 64 km/h) and compliance is even more important than others.
However, interestingly, telephone services are stronger here than on other routes, for example, Pennsylvania Wilds.
The pastries of Germany are delicious, and in Bavaria, they are greater and equally as good as those of its neighbor to the south, Austria.
A common dessert is fruit cake, where apples are baked year-round, and berries and plums are baked in season.
Some German baked goods contain almonds, hazelnuts, and other nuts. Popular cakes are often enjoyed with a cup of coffee.
If you want a small but nutritious pastry, try the local one called a Berliner, Pfannkuchen, or Krapfen.
Curry is a dish made with spices and flavorful vegetables, to which meat or green vegetables are added.
Curry can be "thick" or "watery" depending on the amount of water present.
In the northern states of India and Pakistan, yogurt is commonly used in curry sauces; in South India and the rest of the continent, coconut milk is the preferred concoction.
With 17,000 islands to choose from, Indonesian cuisine is an umbrella term that includes indigenous dishes from many regions of the nation.
Unless otherwise indicated, the phrase refers to food originating in the east and central regions of Java.
Now commonly found throughout the islands, Javanese cuisine includes snacks and lightly seasoned meals, and the main seasonings of Javanese dishes are generally peanuts, chilies, sugar (especially Javanese coconut sugar) and other aromatic spices.
The Stirrups are supports that hang down under the feet from the sides of the saddle.
This makes them more supportive of the rider but poses safety concerns because the rider's feet can become trapped within the material.
If the rider falls off the horse and his foot gets caught in the stirrups, he can be dragged if the horse runs away. To reduce the risk, many precautions should be taken.
Firstly, most riders wear boots that have a heel and a stiff sole with a grip.
Next, some saddles, especially the English ones, have safety devices that cause the leather straps to fall off the saddle if pulled over by a fallen rider.
The Cochamó Valley is a key climbing area in Chile, known as South America's Yosemite due to its wide array of sandstone walls.
High places include seeing things from a birds-eye view. Climbers from all over the world keep opening new routes on its endless wall.
Snowboarding, which includes gliding and hiking, is a popular sport that involves jumping down a snow-covered slope while wearing skis or a snowboard attached to your feet.
Skiing is a popular leisure activity followed by many, sometimes known as "ski bums," who plan to spend their vacation skiing in a certain area.
Skating dates back much further, with cave paintings showing skaters dating back to 5000 BC!
Skiing as a sport can be traced to the 17th century, and in 1861 the first ski club was opened by Norwegians in Australia.
Ski camping: This activity is known as mountaineering, tramping, or backcountry skiing.
Related but not usually included in the style of alpine skiing is downhill/mountain climbing, the latter performed on a sloping gradient and requiring strong skis and boots.
The way of skiing is similar to the way of hiking when ascending a mountain.
If the conditions are right, you will be able to travel faster than walking, but it is not common to go skiing with poles without carrying a backpack on a paved road.
Europe is a small continent with many sovereign countries. Under normal circumstances, traveling to many countries may mean that you have to constantly apply for visas and carry numerous passports.
The Schengen zone, however, operates as if it were one country.
