This not only confirms that at least some dinosaurs had feathers, which is already a widely accepted theory, but also provides details that fossils generally cannot provide, such as color and three-dimensional arrangement.
According to scientists, the animal's feathers were brown on the upper part and brown or yellowish on the lower part.
The invention also gives insight into the development of feathers in birds.
Since dinosaur feathers lack a well-developed plumage called a feather tail but possess other feather features such as pointed barbs and quills, researchers have suggested that the feather tail was most likely a later evolutionary development than these other characteristics.
The structure of the feathers suggests that they were not used for flight, but rather for temperature regulation or display. The researchers suggest that although this is a young dinosaur's tail, the specimen shows an adult feather rather than a chick's down.
Researchers speculate that even though this is a juvenile dinosaur tail, the specimen shows an adult feather, not a chick's down.
Yesterday morning, a car bomb exploded at the Gaziantep Police Station in Turkey, killing two police officers and injuring over twenty others.
The governor's office announced that nineteen of the injured were police officers.
The police stated that they suspect ISIS (ISIL) militants to be responsible for the attack.

The work carried out was primarily theoretical, but the program was written to enhance observations made from the Milky Way galaxy.
The effect the team was looking for would be created by tidal forces between the galaxy's dark matter and the Milky Way's dark matter.
Just as the moon's gravitational force affects the Earth, causing tides, the Milky Way exerts its force on the Milky Way galaxy.
Scientists were able to conclude that dark matter affects other dark matter in the same way as ordinary matter.
According to this view, a large portion of dark matter around the galaxy takes the form of a halo that surrounds the galaxy and is composed of many small particles.

Dr. Tony Moll discovered an extremely drug-resistant form of tuberculosis (XDR-TB) in the KwaZulu-Natal region of South Africa.
In one interview, he said that the new variant was "very worrying and alarming due to the very high death rate."
Dr. Mollie believes that some patients may have been infected with the virus while in the hospital, and at least two of them were hospital nurses.
In a year, one infected person can infect 10-15 contacts.
Nevertheless, the proportion of TB patients who are resistant to multiple drugs is still low among the entire group of patients, with only 6,000 out of 330,000 infected in South Africa at any given time.

Infrared images of temperature changes from night to day indicate that they are likely caves.
During the day, they are cooler than the surrounding surface, while at night they are warmer.
"Their thermal behavior isn’t as stable as Earth’s large caverns, which often maintain a fairly constant temperature, but it is consistent with those of deep-seated holes in the ground," said Glenn Cushing, of the U.S. Geological Survey’s Astrogeology team and Northern Arizona University in Flagstaff, Arizona.
Voting in France is traditionally done using simple technology. Voters enter a voting booth and put a pre-printed ballot paper into an envelope, where they indicate the candidate they have chosen.
Once the official verifies the voter's identity, the voter puts the envelope in the ballot box and signs the ballot.
French electoral law is quite strict in regulating information.
Since 1988, polling stations have been required to be transparent so that voters and observers can verify that there are no envelopes at the beginning of the voting and that no envelopes have been added, except those that have been properly counted and allocated to voters.
Candidates may send representatives to personally attend each stage of the process. At night, votes are counted by volunteers under strictly supervised conditions, following specific procedures.

His first race was a ski competition where his first run was rated as "Unfinished." Of the 116 competitors, 36 had the same result in that race.
In her other giant slalom race, in the women's sitting group, she finished tenth in a combined time of 4:41.30, which was 2:11.60 minutes slower than first-place finisher Claudia Losh of Austria and 1:09.02 minutes slower than ninth-place finisher Gyöngyö Dané of Hungary.
Four skaters in the women's group failed their race while out of 117 skaters in the giant slalom, 45 did not manage to qualify for the race.
The Madhya Pradesh Police recovered and returned the stolen laptop and mobile phone.
Deputy Inspector General D.K. Aryan said, "We have arrested five men who had raped the Swiss woman and have returned her cell phone and laptop."
The names of the accused are Baba Kanjar, Bhutta Kanjar, Rampro Kanjar, Gaza Kanjar, and Vishnu Kanjar.
Police Superintendent Chandra Shekhar Solanki said the accused had come to court wearing face veils.
Despite there being three people inside the house when the car hit it, none of them were injured.
However, the driver suffered severe head injuries.
The road where the accident occurred was temporarily closed while emergency services removed the driver from the red Audi TT.
At first, he was transferred to James Paget Hospital in Great Yarmouth.
He was later transferred to Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge.
Since then, Adekoya has been in Edinburgh Sheriff's Court on charges of murdering his son.
He was in detention awaiting indictment and trial, but any witness testimony may have been tainted since his photograph had been widely published.
This is generally a widespread practice in the United Kingdom, but the Scottish justice system works differently, and the courts view the publication of photographs as potentially prejudicial.
Professor Pamela Ferguson at the University of Dundee notes that “journalists are putting themselves at risk by publishing pictures and other materials of suspects.”
The Crown Office, responsible for carrying out prosecutions, informed reporters that no further comment would be made until the indictment is presented, at the very least.
According to the leak, the document pertains to the border dispute and Palestine wants the borders to be based on pre-1967 Middle East war borders.
Other topics reportedly discussed include the future status of Jerusalem, which is sacred to both nations, and the Jordan Valley issue.
Israel demands a continuous military presence in the valley for ten years after the signing of the agreement, while the Palestinian Authority agrees to allow such presence for only five years.
During the additional trial of pest control, the fires were subject to direct supervision by rangers, as the trial was monitored and its effectiveness evaluated.
In collaboration with the National Parks and Wildlife Service and the Sporting Shooters Association of Australia, qualified volunteers were recruited as part of the Sporting Shooters Association's hunting program.
According to Mick O'Flynn, who is the acting director of Zbosoygo Conservation and Heritage at the National Parks and Wildlife Service, the four shooters selected for the first shooting operation had undergone extensive safety and training.
Yesterday, Martelli was sworn in at the new Provisional Electoral Council composed of nine members.
It is the fifth heavy package in four years delivered by Martell's express mail.
Last month, a presidential commission recommended the resignation of the former Provisional Electoral Council (CEP) as part of a package of measures to move the country towards new elections.
The commission was Martelli's response to the widespread protests against the ruling power that had begun in October.
Sometimes the failure to hold elections has become a catalyst for violent protests, dating back as far as 2011.
There have been around 60 reported cases of iPod overheating malfunctions, resulting in six fires, with four people suffering minor burns.
Japan's Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) said it was aware of 27 incidents involving the devices.
Last week, METI announced that Apple reported 34 more cases of overheating, which the company called "serious".
The ministry had responded by calling the delay of Apple's report "truly regrettable."
The earthquake hit Mariana at 7:19 a.m. local time (9:19 p.m. GMT on Friday).
The Office of Emergency Management for the Northern Mariana Islands announced that there had been no reports of damage in the country.
The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center also reported that there was no sign of a tsunami.
A former Philippine policeman held Hong Kong tourists hostage by hijacking their bus in Manila, the capital of the Philippines.
Rolando Mendoza fired his M16 rifle at the tourists.
Several hostages have been rescued, and it is confirmed that at least six people have died so far.
Six prisoners, including children and adults, were released early, as were the Filipino photographers.
The photographers then took the place of an elderly woman when she needed the bathroom. She was stabbed with a machete.
The Ligginses followed in their father's footsteps and chose to become doctors.
She was trained as a midwife and began working at the National Women's Hospital in Oakland in 1959.
While working at the hospital, Liggins began studying preterm births in her free time.
According to his research, the maturation of the fetal lungs can be accelerated with the help of administering a single hormone.
Xinhua reported that on Wednesday, government investigators recovered two black boxes of flight recordings.
Fellow wrestlers also paid their respects to Luna.
Tommy Dreamer said, "Luna was the first lady of the extreme. My first boss. Luna died on the night of two moons. Just as unique as she was. A strong woman."
Dustin "Goldust" Runnels noted that "Luna was as crazy as I was... maybe even more so... that he loved her and would miss her... hoping she was in a better place."
In a poll of 1,400 people before the 2010 federal election, those opposed to Australia becoming a republic had risen by 8 percent since 2008.
Acting Prime Minister Julia Gillard, during her 2010 federal election campaign, claimed that she believed Australia should become a republic at the end of Queen Elizabeth II's reign.
34% of those surveyed share this view: they want Queen Elizabeth II to be the last monarch of Australia.
In the last survey, 29% of respondents believed that Australia would become a republic as soon as possible, while 31% believed that Australia would never become a republic.
The Olympic gold medalist was to swim in the 100m and 200m freestyle and compete in three different diving events at the Commonwealth Games, but due to her injuries, her fitness was in question.
He was unable to take the necessary medication to alleviate his pain because they are prohibited by the games.
Curtis Cooper, a mathematician and computer science professor at the University of Central Missouri, discovered the largest known prime number on January 25.
Several people confirmed the discovery using various hardware and software by the beginning of February, and it was announced on Tuesday.
Comets may have been the source of water and organic material on Earth, which could form proteins and support life.
Scientists hope to understand how planets form, specifically how the Earth was formed, since comets collided with Earth many years ago.
Cuomo, 53, began his administration earlier this year and last month signed a bill legalizing same-sex marriage.
He described the gossip as "political rhetoric and stupidity."
It is expected that he will run for president in 2016.
NextGen is a system that, according to the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), will allow aircraft to fly shorter routes and save millions of gallons of fuel each year, while reducing carbon emissions.
It uses satellite-based technology, in contrast to the old ground-based radar technology, to let air traffic controllers pinpoint aircraft with greater accuracy and provide more precise information to pilots.
No additional transportation will be provided, and no underground trains will stop at Wembley, while car parking, vehicle parking and other transportation facilities are unavailable.
Concerns about the lack of transportation increased the likelihood that the game would have to be played behind closed doors, without any team supporters.
A study published in the journal Science on Thursday reported the formation of a new bird species in the Galapagos Islands of Ecuador.
Researchers at Princeton University in the United States and Uppsala University in Sweden reported that the new species evolved in just two generations, despite the fact that this process is believed to have taken much longer due to a cross between Darwin's endemic serinos, a medium-sized terrestrial serinos, and the dry cactus serinos, the serinos conirosis.
Gold can take any shape. It can be rolled into tiny molds.
It can be pulled by a thin metal wire that can be rolled and stitched. It can be rolled or flattened into sheet form.
It can be made very thin and inserted into another metal. It could be made so thin that it was sometimes used to decorate hand-painted pictures in books, which are called illuminated manuscripts.
This is called chemical pH. You can use red cabbage juice as an indicator.
Cabbage juice changes color depending on whether the chemical composition is acidic or alkaline.
The pH level in a tested chemical compound is indicated by the number of hydrogen (H) ions in the pH.
Hydrogen ions are protons that have had their electrons stripped away from them (because hydrogen atoms are made up of one proton and one electron).
Mix the two dry powders together and then, with clean, wet hands, press it into a ball.
The moisture on your hands will react with the outer layers, which will become slippery and create a kind of barrier.
In Harappa and Mohenjo-Daro, nearly every house had a bathroom connected to a complex sewer system.
Remains of plumbing systems have been discovered in houses in the Minoan cities of Crete and Santorini in Greece.
Bathrooms were also present in ancient Egypt, Persia, and China. During the Roman civilization, the bathhouses were sometimes part of public baths, where men and women were allowed to be together in the same place.
When you call someone who is thousands of miles away, you are using a satellite.
In space, the satellite receives the call and responds almost instantly.
The satellite was launched into space by rocket. Scientists use telescopes in space because the Earth's atmosphere distorts some of our light and vision.
To put a satellite or telescope in space, you need a giant rocket that is 100 feet long.
The wheel has changed the world in unbelievable ways, and the greatest thing the wheel has done is provide us with easier and faster means of transportation.
It has given us the train, the car, and many other modes of transportation.
Most of them are medium-sized cats that eat medium-sized prey, ranging from rabbits to deer and antelopes.
And finally, there are many small cats (including free-ranging domestic cats) that feed on a much larger number of small prey, such as insects, rodents, reptiles, and birds.
Their success lies in the concept of the orphan, where each cat has a specific job that keeps it from competing with others.
Lions are the most social of all cats, living in large groups called prides.
Prides are made up of one to three related adult males, with up to thirty females and young.
Female representatives are usually more closely related, being part of a large family of sisters and daughters.
Lion prides often behave similarly to packs of wolves or dogs, with the animals strikingly similar in behavior to lions (but not other big cats) and also very deadly to their prey.
A well-developed athlete, the tiger can juggle (not so well, though), swim, jump long distances, and pull with five times the strength of a strong man.
The tiger is in the same genus (Panthera) as lions, leopards, and jaguars. These four cats are the only cats that can roar.
The roar of a tiger is not like a lion's full-voiced roar, but more like a single phrase of muttering, screaming words.
Ocelots like to eat small animals, and when given the opportunity, they will catch monkeys, snakes, rodents, and birds. Almost all animals that are hunted by the ocelot are relatively small compared to it.
Scientists believe that ocelots track and locate their prey by scent, sniffing out all the places on the ground where they have been.
With their night vision, ocelots can see very well and also move very stealthily. They hunt their prey by blending into their environment, then pouncing on it.
When a small group of organisms (a small population) separates from the main population from which it originated (for example, if they move across a mountain range or a river, or if they move to a new island so that they cannot easily return), they will permanently appear in a different environment from their previous environment.
This new environment has different resources and competitors, so to be a strong competitor, the new population will need different traits and adaptability than previously required.
The native population has not changed at all, they still need the same accommodations as before.
Over time, as the new population begins to adapt to their new environment, they become less and less like other populations.
Eventually, after thousands or even millions of years, the two populations will become so different that it will not be possible to call them the same species.
We call this process "speciation", which simply means the formation of new species. Speciation is an inevitable consequence and a very important part of evolution.
Plants produce oxygen, which humans breathe, and they inhale carbon dioxide, which humans exhale (that is, they release air).
Plants get their food through photosynthesis. They also provide shade.
We build our houses from plants and make our clothes from plants. Most of our food is plant-based. Without plants, animals could not survive.
The Mozaza was the top predator of its time, so it was not afraid of anything, except for other Mozazas.
Its long jaws contained more than 70 sharp, charcoal-like teeth, with an additional row on the upper part of its mouth, meaning nothing could escape its path.
We don't know for sure, but it could have had a forked tongue. Its diet included frogs, large fish, other mosasaurs, and it could have even been a man-eater.
It attacked anything that entered the water, even the giant dinosaur Tyrannosaurus Rex, it was nothing to it.
While most of their food would be familiar to us, the Romans ate a variety of unusual or exotic animals, including wild boar, dormice, snails, and a type of rodent called a dormouse.
Another variation was that, while the poor men and women sat on chairs eating their bread, the rich preferred to organize banquets together, where they would sit side by side while eating their meals.
Ancient Roman cuisine did not include foods that had come from Europe, America, or Asia in earlier times.
For example, they had no corn, no tomatoes, no potatoes, no cocoa, and no ancient Roman had ever tasted turkey.
The Babylonians built a main temple for each of their gods, which was considered to be the house of the god.
People offered sacrifices to the gods, and priests tried to satisfy the needs of the gods through rituals and festivals.
Each temple has an open courtyard and an inner shrine, where only priests can enter.
Sometimes, special pyramid-shaped towers called ziggurats were built as part of the temple.
The top of the tower was a special sacred place for the god.
In the hot climate of the Middle East, the home was not of such great importance.
A large part of the Jewish family's life was spent in the open air.
Women were cooking in the courtyard and the shops had open displays facing the street. Stone was used to build houses.
There were no large forests in the land of Canaan, so wood was very expensive.
Greenland is sparsely populated. Norwegian lay historians note that Erik the Red was banished from Iceland for murder, and when he traveled further west, he discovered and named it Greenland.
Nevertheless, at the time of its discovery, Eskimo groups were already living there.
Despite each country being "Scandinavian", there were many differences between the people, kings, customs, and history of Denmark, Sweden, Norway, and Iceland.
If you have watched the movie "National Treasure", you might think that the treasure map was depicted on the back of the Declaration of Independence.
But that's not true. Despite the fact that something is written on the back of the paper, it's not a treasure map.
The words inscribed on the back of the Declaration of Independence were: "Original Declaration of Independence dated July 4, 1776." The text appears in italics at the bottom of the document.
While no one is certain who wrote it, it is known that the large vellum document had previously been in storage, measuring 29 3/4 inches in length and 24 1/2 inches in width.
Consequently, it is possible that the footnote was added as a mere trademark.
The Normandy landings and subsequent battles liberated the north of France, but the south was not yet liberated.
It was ruled by the Vichy French, who were the French that made peace with the Germans in 1940 and collaborated with the invaders instead of fighting against them.
On August 15, 1940, the Allies landed in Southern France, the invasion was called Operation Dragoon.
In just two weeks, American and French independent forces had liberated Southern France and were moving towards Germany.
Civilization is a complex culture shared by a fairly large group of people who live and work together: society.
The word "civilization" comes from the Latin word "civilis", meaning "civilized", which is related to the Latin word "civis", meaning "citizen", and "civitas", meaning "city" or "city-state", and it also somehow defines the dimensions of society.
City-states are the forerunners of nations. Urban civilization involves the transmission of knowledge through several generations, long-lasting cultural traces, and the fair distribution of information.
Small cultures often disappear, leaving no relevant historical evidence, and thus are not recognized as proper civilizations.
During the Revolutionary War, the thirteen states initially formed a weak central government, where within the framework of the Articles of Confederation, Congress was its only component.
Congress had no power to tax, and as there was no national executive or judicial body, it relied on state governments, which often refused to cooperate in enforcing all its laws.
It also did not have the authority to override tax laws and tariffs between the states.
The Articles required unanimous consent from all the states before they could be amended, and the states didn't take the central government seriously enough that their representatives were often absent.
The Italian national football team is the second most successful team in the world, behind Germany's national football team, and the champion of the 2006 FIFA World Cup.
Popular sports include football, basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, roller hockey, and F1 motor racing.
Winter sports are more widespread in northern regions, with Italians participating in international competitions and the Olympic Games.
Japan has nearly 7,000 islands (the largest being Honshu), making it the seventh largest island in the world.
Due to the grouping of its islands, Japan is often referred to as an archipelago from a geographical perspective.
The origins of Taiwan are traced back to the 15th century, when European sailors passing through recorded the island's name as Ilha Formosa, or Beautiful Island.
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company established a base in southwestern Taiwan, initiating a reorganization of the local grain cultivation practices and hiring Chinese laborers to work on its rice and sugar plantations.
In 1683, the Qing Dynasty (1644-1912) troops took control of the western and northern coastal areas of Taiwan, and in 1885, Taiwan was proclaimed a province of the Qing Empire.
In 1895, after the defeat in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Qing government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki, ceding sovereignty over Taiwan to Japan, which governed the island until 1945.
Machu Picchu is made up of three main structures, specifically the Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun, and the Room of Three Windows.
Most of the buildings at the edges of the complex have been reconstructed to give tourists a better idea of their original appearance.
30% of Machu Picchu was restored in 1976, and the restoration continues to this day.
For example, the most commonly used format for photographic still images in the world is 35 mm, which was the dominant film size towards the end of the analogue film era.
It is still being made today, but more importantly, its width-to-height ratio is derived from the image sensor formats of digital cameras.
The 35mm format is actually a bit misleading, being 36mm wide and 24mm high.
Consequently, the ratio of the sides of this format (divided by twelve, so we can get the simplest ratio of whole numbers), as it is said, is 3:2.
Many common formats (such as the APS family of formats) are equivalent or close to this side ratio.
The often-maligned and frequently-abused rule of thirds is a simple guideline that creates dynamic composition by maintaining order in the picture.
It indicates that the most effective part of the main theme is the intersection point, which divides the image vertically and horizontally into three parts (see example).
The Catholic Church, having become rich and powerful, came under control at this time in European history.
Christianity has united European nations for more than a thousand years despite their differences in language and customs.
Its universal dominance of power impacted everyone, from the king to mere mortals.
One of the basic principles of Christianity is that wealth should be used to alleviate suffering and poverty and that church funds are particularly for that purpose.
The central structure of the church has been in Rome for nearly a thousand years, and this concentration of power and wealth led many to question whether this doctrine had been maintained.
Immediately after the outbreak of hostilities, Britain began a naval blockade of Germany.
The strategy proved effective, halting the supply of vital military and civilian goods, even though this blockade violated universally accepted international law, enshrined in several international agreements adopted in the last two centuries.
Britain was dredging international waters to prevent any vessel from entering entire sections of the ocean, even endangering neutral ships.
As there was a limited response to this maneuver, Germany was anticipating a similar response to its submarine fleet's unrestricted military actions.
During the 1920s, the dominant approach of many citizens and nations was that of pacifism and isolationism.
After witnessing the horrors and atrocities of World War I, nations wanted to avoid a repeat of that situation in the future.
In 1884, Tesla moved to the United States to accept a job with the Edison Company in New York City.
He arrived in the United States with four cents, a book of poems, and a letter of recommendation from Charles Batchelor (his former boss) addressed to Thomas Edison.
Ancient China had a unique way of representing different periods of time. Each family or ruling dynasty in China was considered as a separate dynasty.
There was also a period of instability between the divided states of each dynasty. The most famous of these periods was the Three Kingdoms period, which lasted 60 years between the Han and Jin dynasties.
During this period, there were fierce battles between many nobles fighting for the throne.
The Three Kingdoms was the bloodiest period in ancient Chinese history, with thousands of people dying in the struggle for the highest throne in the Great Palace of Xi'an.
There are a number of social and political influences, such as the implementation of the metric system, the transition from absolutism to republicanism, nationalism, and the belief that the state belongs to the people, not just one ruler.
Besides that, after the revolution, professions were open to all male applicants, allowing the most ambitious and successful to achieve success.
The same applies to soldiers as well, as now, instead of the military rank system based on class, they were based on size.
The French Revolution also inspired many other oppressed representatives of the working class in other countries to start their own revolutions.
Muhammad was deeply interested in matters beyond this worldly life and for meditation, he often visited a cave on Mount Hira, known as Nur (light).
The ancient cave vividly portrays the spiritual struggles of Muhammad.
Perched atop one of the northern mountains of Mecca, the cave is completely cut off from the rest of the world.
In fact, it's not easy to find, even if someone knows it existed. Once inside the cave it was a valuable discovery.
The view is limited to the beautiful sky and the many surrounding mountains. Little of this world can be seen or heard from inside the cave.
The Great Pyramid of Giza is the only one of the Seven Wonders of the World still standing.
The Egyptians built the Great Pyramid in the 3rd century B.C. It is one of many large pyramidal structures built to honor a deceased pharaoh.
The Giza Plateau or the "Necropolis of Giza" contains several pyramids (the largest of which is the Great Pyramid), several small tombs, several temples, and a large Sphinx.
The Great Pyramid was built to honor Pharaoh Khufu, while many of the smaller pyramids, tombs, and temples were built to honor Khufu's wife and family members.
The "upper arch" is similar to a "V" shape, while the "lower arch symbol" is similar to a square bracket or a square with its bottom edge missing.
"Up" means you start at the top and pull the bow, while "down" means you start at the end of the rod (where your hand is holding the bow) and pull the bow.
A high bow usually produces a softer sound, while a low bow produces a louder and more consistent sound.
You may use a pencil to write your own notes, but remember that the printed markings are there for musical purposes, and so you should normally take them into account.
On October 6, 1789, the frightened King Louis XVI, Queen Marie Antoinette, their two young children (11-year-old Marie-Thérèse and 4-year-old Louis-Charles), and the king's sister, Lady Elizabeth, were forced to flee from Versailles to Paris after being attacked by a group of market women.
They returned to Paris in a carriage surrounded by a crowd of people shouting and making threats at the queen and the king.
The crowd forced the king and queen to open the window of their carriage wide.
At one point, a member of the crowd, in front of the terrified queen, brandished the head of a royal soldier killed at Versailles.
The costs of the US imperialist war to conquer the Philippines were paid for by the Filipinos themselves.
They were obliged to pay taxes to the US colonial administration to cover most of the interest and expenses on the bonds placed on behalf of the Philippine government through Wall Street banking structures.
Of course, the gains from the long-term exploitation of the Filipino people would be the primary accomplishments of US imperialism.
In order to understand the Templars, one must understand the context that contributed to the formation of the order.
The year in which the events occurred is commonly referred to as the Early Middle Ages, a period of European history in the 11th, 12th, and 13th centuries (1000-1300 AD).
The High Middle Ages was preceded by the Early Middle Ages and followed by the Late Middle Ages, which conventionally ended around 1500.
Technological determinism is a concept that covers a wide range of practical ideas, from technological momentum or technological imperative to the very notion that human fate is driven by fundamental logic, linked to scientific laws and other expressions of technology.
Most interpretations of technological determinism share two main ideas: that the development of technology itself follows a path that is largely outside of cultural or political influence and that technology in turn has effects on individual societies rather than being driven by society.
For example, it can be said that a car with an engine inevitably leads to the development of roads.
However, a nationwide road network is not economically sustainable for only a small number of cars, so new production methods are being developed to reduce the cost of car ownership.
The widespread use of cars on the road also leads to a large number of accidents, which in turn leads to the development of new techniques in the healthcare field to treat injured bodies.
Romanticism is a significant element of cultural determinism, which can be seen in such writers as Goethe, Fichte and Schlegel.
In the context of Romanticism, geography shaped individuals, and over time the customs and culture associated with that geography grew. The latter, being in harmony with the wilderness of society, were better than arbitrarily enforced laws.
Just as Paris is known as the fashion capital of the modern world, so Constantinople was seen as the fashion capital of feudal Europe.
As the epicenter of the plague, it became known around 400 AD, after Christ, and lasted until approximately 1100 AD.
During the twelfth century, its status declined especially due to the fact that the Crusaders returned to the island, bringing with them gifts such as silk items and spices that were worth more than what the Byzantine markets offered.
It was at this time that the capital of fashion changed from Constantinople to Paris.
The Gothic style flourished in the 10th, 11th, and 14th centuries.
In the early period, Byzantine culture had a great influence on dress in the East.
However, due to slow communication routes, styles in the West could lag behind by 25 to 30 years.
At the end of the Middle Ages, Western Europe began to develop its own style and one of the great achievements of that time was the use of buttons to fasten clothing, which was a result of the Crusades.
The purpose of subsistence farming is to produce enough food to meet the needs of the farmer and his family.
Agriculture is simple, often an organic system that uses specifically preserved seeds for an ecological region, combined with crop rotation or other relatively simple methods to maximize yields.
Historically, many farmers have been involved in subsistence agriculture, and this is still the case in many developing countries.
Subcultures are formed by individuals who share similar beliefs and feel neglected by societal standards, allowing them to develop a sense of identity.
Subcultures can vary based on age, ethnicity, class, location and/or gender of the members.
The qualities that define a particular subset can be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographical, or a combination of factors.
Members of a subculture often express their affiliation through the use of a distinctive and symbolic style that includes being fashionable, satire, and the misuse of terms.
One of the most prevalent methods used to show the importance of socialization is to examine several unfortunate cases of children who, having endured neglect, misfortune, and intentional abuse by adults, failed to be socialized by adults as they grew older.
Children like these are called "feral" or "wild." Some feral children have been confined by humans, usually by their parents. In some cases, the abandonment of these children is due to the parent's refusal to seriously mentally or physically harm the child.
Wild children may have experienced cruel exploitation or trauma before being abandoned or fleeing.
It is believed that others were raised by animals; some are said to have lived independently in the wild.
When a feral child is raised by non-domesticated animals, they exhibit behavior, physically, that is almost entirely similar to that of particularly wary animals, such as fear or indifference towards humans.
While programming courses are meant to make learning easier and more engaging, code generation is a step in that direction.
Code generation is not a teaching method, but rather a tool to help individuals who are going through a new learning experience, such as using a new computer program or starting a new project.
Stickers can be virtual or physical; in other words, the teacher is a form of sticker, but so is the man with the small filing cabinet in the Microsoft office.
Virtual logs are integrated into the software and are designed to ask, suggest, and explain procedures that might have been difficult for a student to handle on their own.
Children are placed in foster care for a variety of reasons, ranging from neglect, abuse, to even abandonment.
No child should grow up in an environment that is not nourishing, caring, and educational, but there are still those that do.
We believe that the foster family system is considered a safety net for these children.
Our foster care system is supposed to provide safe homes, loving caregivers, stable education, and reliable health care.
The adoptive family is expected to provide for all the needs that were not met in the home from which they were removed.
The Internet integrates elements of both mass and interpersonal communication.
The unique nature of the Internet leads to additional criteria in terms of usage and satisfaction.
For example, "learning" and "socialization" have been suggested as important motives for using the internet (James et al., 1995).
Amy and McCord also considered "personal engagement" and "continuing relationships" to be aspects of having new motivations (1998) when they studied audience responses to websites.
Video has led to important discoveries in the interpretation of micro-expressions and facial movements that last for just a few milliseconds.
In particular, they argue that it is possible to determine whether someone is lying by correctly interpreting their micro-expressions.
In his paper "The President's Speech", Oliver Sacks pointed out how people who have a disability in understanding speech due to brain damage are still able to accurately assess sincerity.
He even mentioned that animals, like for example domestic dogs, may have the ability to interpret human behavior.
20th-century research has shown that there are two types of genetic variation: hidden and expressed.
Mutation introduces a new evolutionary change, while selection removes it from the list of demonstrated changes.
Recombination and mutation mix up the changes between the two units in each generation.
Out on the savannah, a primate with a human-like digestive system struggles to meet its amino acid needs with the available plant resources.
Moreover, not being able to do it has serious consequences such as stunted growth, malnutrition and, in the end, death.
The most available plant resources would be leaves, which were accessible in the trees and canopies, but like in our case, it is difficult for primates to digest them because they are not cooked.
Unlike animals (such as ants, termites, and eggs), not only are they easier to digest, but they also provide a high amount of protein, containing all the essential amino acids.
Considering all the circumstances, we should not be surprised to learn that our ancestors solved their "protein problem" in much the same way as chimpanzees do today in the savannah.
Sleep interruption is the process of deliberately waking up during your normal sleep time and then going back to sleep shortly afterwards (10-60 minutes later).
This can be done easily by using a relatively quiet alarm clock that will bring you to consciousness without fully waking you up.
If you change the alarm clock time again when you go to sleep, you can place it on the other side of the room, which will force you to get out of bed to turn it off.
Other options based on biological rhythms include drinking plenty of fluids (especially water or tea) before bed, which will make a person wake up to urinate.
The degree of inner peace of a person is inversely proportional to the degree of tension present in the body and mind.
The lower the stress, the more positive the energy you have towards life. Each person has the inner strength to find absolute peace and contentment.
Anyone can obtain an education. The only thing that can hold us back from achieving this goal is our own laziness and negativity.
Tibetan Buddhism is founded on the teachings of Buddha, but has spread through the Mahayana path of love and the various practices of Indian yoga.
In principle, Tibetan Buddhism is very simple: it's a combination of Kundalini yoga, meditation, and the path of all-encompassing love.
In Kundalini yoga, Kundalini energy, or the energy of light, is awakened through yoga postures, breathing exercises, mantras, and meditations.
The center of Tibetan meditation is divine yoga. The visualization of various deities clears the energy pathways, activates chakras and creates enlightenment consciousness.
Germany was a common enemy in World War II, which led to the cooperation of the USSR and the United States. At the end of the war, systemic, procedural, and cultural conflicts forced the countries to abandon the agreement.
Two years after the war ended, the former allies became enemies, and the Cold War began.
It was meant to last for the next 40 years and the replacement, actual armies, were to fight battles from Africa to Asia, in Afghanistan, Cuba and many other places.
By September 17th, 1939, the Polish defenses had already collapsed, and the only hope was to retreat and reorganize along the Romanian border.
However, these plans were nearly ruined overnight when about 800,000 soldiers of the Soviet Union's Red Army entered and established the Belorussian and Ukrainian fronts after invading Poland's eastern regions, breaching the Riga Peace Treaty, the Soviet-Polish Non-Aggression Pact, and other international agreements, both bilateral and multilateral.
Using ships to transport goods has long been the most efficient way to move large numbers of people and goods across the oceans.
The naval forces' job has been to ensure that your country can keep its people and goods moving while simultaneously hindering your enemy from moving their people and goods.
One recent notable example of this was the North Atlantic campaign during World War II, when the Americans were trying to transport men and supplies across the Atlantic to help Britain.
At the same time, the German navy, which was mainly using its submarines, was trying to block this route.
If the Allies had failed, Germany would most likely have been able to invade Britain, as well as the rest of Europe.
It seems that goats were first domesticated in the Zagros Mountains of Iran about 10,000 years ago.
Ancient cultures and tribes began to preserve these—milk, hair, meat, and flour— in order to make them readily available.
Domestic goats were typically kept in herds that grazed on hills or pastures, and were often followed by goat herders, who were usually children or young adults, as were herders with larger ranges. These methods of grazing are still in use today.
The footpaths were built in England as early as the 16th century.
Although the wagons were only made of parallel wooden planks, they allowed the horses to pull them to reach higher speeds and to pull larger loads than on the relatively less smooth roads of the day.
Railroad spikes were introduced early on to hold railroad tracks in place, but it gradually became clear that the tracks would be more efficient if they were covered with iron from above.
This became a standard practice, but the iron on the wooden wheels of the wagons caused much more wear.
Ultimately, wooden wheels were replaced with iron wheels, and the first all-iron lines were introduced in 1767.
The first known mode of transportation was walking and humans began walking upright two million years ago with the rise of Homo Erectus, meaning upright human.
Their predecessors, the Australopithecus, normally did not walk upright.
Two-legged specialization was discovered in the fossils of Australopithecus from 4.2-3.9 million years ago, even though Sahelanthropus may have walked on two legs as early as seven million years ago.
We can start living in a more environmentally-friendly manner, we can join the environmental protection movement, and we can become activists to reduce future suffering to some extent.
It's just like treating the symptoms in many cases. However, if we want more than just a temporary solution, we need to get to the root of the problem and get rid of it.
It is obvious that the world has changed greatly due to the scientific and technological advancements made by humanity, and the problems have increased due to overpopulation and the result of people living recklessly.
When Congress passed it on July 4th, a handwritten copy signed by Congress President John Hancock and Secretary Charles Thomson was sent to John Dunlap's print shop, a few blocks away.
150 to 200 copies were made overnight, now known as the "Dunleaf Broad Sheets."
On July 8th, the document was first publicly read by John Nixon in the courtyard of Independence Hall.
One was sent to George Washington on July 6, who read it to his troops in New York on July 9. A copy arrived in London on August 10.
As of today, the 25 Dunlop Lines, known to still exist, are the oldest surviving examples of the document. The original manuscript has not survived.
Today, many paleontologists believe that a group of dinosaurs survived and are still alive today. We call them birds.
Many people do not consider them to be dinosaurs because they have feathers and can fly.
But there is a lot of talk about the birds that are still considered similar to dinosaurs.
They have legs covered in spots and claws, lay eggs, and walk on their two hind legs like tyrannosaurs.
In fact, all computers in use today are based on processing information encoded in binary numbers.
A binary number system can only have one of two values, such as 0 or 1, and these numbers are called binary digits or bits in computer language.
Internal poisoning may not be immediately obvious. Symptoms such as vomiting are common enough that an immediate diagnosis cannot be made.
The best indication of internal poisoning may be the presence of an open container of medication or toxic household chemicals.
Check the label to see the first-aid instructions for the specific poison.
The term medium is used by entomologists to officially refer to this group of insects.
This term originated from an old familiarity with woodpeckers, which are intermediaries highly adapted to parasitizing humans.
Killer insects and woodpeckers are sedentary, adapted to live within their host's nest or community.
There are about 400,000 documented cases of multiple sclerosis in the United States, proving that it is still the most common neurological disease among young and middle-aged people.
Cerebral palsy is a disorder that negatively affects the nervous system, which is composed of the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerve.
The study found that women are twice as likely to have a master's degree in science as men.
The couple may decide that having a child is not in their or their child’s best interest.
These couples can choose an adoption plan for their child.
At the time of adoption, the birth parents terminate their parental rights so that another couple can adopt the child.
The fundamental purpose of science is to understand how the world operates through the scientific method, which in fact guides the basic scientific research.
But it is not just an experiment, it is a test that uses questions to disprove one or more of the possible hypotheses, and observations also guide scientific research.
Philosophers and naturalists focused their attention on classical texts, particularly the Latin Bible.
Aristotle's opinions have been accepted in all areas of science, including psychology.
Due to the decline in Greek knowledge, the West was cut off from its Greek philosophical and scientific roots.
Many have observed that the repetition of physiology and behavior is often highly dependent on the presence of endogenous cycles and the creation of endogenous cycles by biological clocks.
Periodic rhythms, which are not mere responses to external periodic cues, have been documented in the majority of living organisms, including bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals.
Our biological clocks are self-sustaining oscillators that will continue to run freely even in the absence of external cues.
Hershey and Chase's experiment was one of the main pieces of evidence suggesting that DNA is the hereditary material.
Hersh and Chase used phages and viruses to insert their own DNA into the bacteria.
They conducted two experiments, labeling the DNA with radioactive phosphorus in one phase or with radioactive sulfur from the protein in another phase.
Mutations can have a range of different effects, depending on the type of mutation, the significance of the part of the genetic material affected, and whether the cells affected are embryonic cells.
Only mutations in embryonic cells can be passed on to children, while other mutations can result in cell death or cancer.
Nature tourism appeals to those who want to visit natural sites for sightseeing, as well as to enjoy the flora and fauna.
Examples of activities on site include hunting, fishing, photography, bird watching and visiting parks, as well as studying information about the ecosystem.
An example would be visiting, photographing, and studying the orangutans in Borneo.
Every morning, people drive from small suburban towns to their workplaces, encountering others on the way whose workplaces are in the very towns they just left.
Everyone on this high-speed commuter train is somehow connected to and supports the private car-based transportation system.
Science now acknowledges that this massive carbon economy has shifted the biosphere away from one of its stable states that supported human development for the past two million years.
Everyone is a part of society and benefits from transportation systems. Almost everyone is dissatisfied with the state of transportation systems.
You don't hear complaints of this level about water quality or collapsing bridges in developed countries.
Why are transportation systems such a source of complaints, why do they fail every day? Are transportation engineers not competent, or is there something more fundamental going on?
Traffic flow studies the movement and interactions between individual drivers and vehicles between two points.
Unfortunately, studying traffic flow is difficult because it is impossible to predict the behavior of a driver 100 percent.
Fortunately, drivers tend to maintain a fairly consistent distance, so the traffic flow tends to have some reasonable consistency and can be roughly represented mathematically.
To better represent the flow of traffic, a relationship has been established between three main parameters: 1) flow, 2) density, and 3) speed.
These relationships help in the planning, designing and operation of road structures.
Insects were the first animals to take to the air. Their ability to fly helped them more easily avoid predators, scavenge for food, and more efficiently find mates.
Most insects have the advantage of being able to fold their wings back along their body.
This allows them to hide from a wide range of predators in small spaces.
Today, the only insects that can't fold their wings back are the beetles and the earwigs.
Thousands of years ago, a man named Aristarchus said that the solar system revolves around the sun.
Some believed he was right, but many believed the opposite- that the solar system, including the Sun (and even other stars), revolved around the Earth.
It's understandable because the Earth doesn't seem to be moving, does it?
The Amazon River is the second-longest river on Earth, and the largest by volume. It carries more than eight times as much water as the second largest river on Earth.
The Amazon is also the widest river on Earth, reaching a width of six miles in some parts.
20 percent of the freshwater that flows into the oceans via the world's rivers comes from the Amazon.
The Amazon River is 6,387 kilometers (3,980 miles) long, where it collects the waters of thousands of smaller rivers.
Although pyramid-shaped structures made of stone survived into the Old Kingdom, the pyramids of Giza were never surpassed in their size and technical excellence of construction.
The ancient Egyptians of the New Kingdom marveled at the monuments of their predecessors, which were already more than a thousand years old at that time.
Vatican City has a population of around 800, making it the smallest independent state in the world and the least populated.
Italian is used in Vatican City for its legislation and official communications.
Italian is also the everyday language used by many of the country's working people, while Latin is often used in religious ceremonies.
All the citizens of the Vatican City are Roman Catholics.
In the ancient world, people knew about the existence of basic chemical elements, such as gold, silver, and copper, because these could be found naturally in nature and were relatively easy to mine with primitive tools.
The philosopher Aristotle developed a theory that everything is composed of one or more of four elements: earth, water, air, and fire.
This was more like the four states of matter (in the same sequence) - solid, liquid, gas, and plasma, although he also suggests that they are transformed into new materials, forming what we see.
Alloys are mainly mixtures of two or more metals. Don't forget that there are basic elements in regular steel.
Elements such as calcium and potassium are considered metals. Of course, there are also metals like silver and gold.
You can also have alloys that contain small amounts of nonmetallic elements, such as carbon.
Everything in the universe is made of matter. All matter is made up of tiny particles called atoms.
Atoms are so incredibly small that trillions of them would fit into just the period at the end of this sentence.
Thus, when the pencil was first introduced, it was a great friend to many.
Unfortunately, as newer methods of writing have emerged, the pencil has become less used and has fallen into a lower status.
People now type messages on computer screens, never needing to reach for a pen.
One can only guess what the keyboard will look like when something newer comes out.
The fission bomb operates on the principle that energy is required to bring together a nucleus with many protons and neutrons.
Pushing a heavy cart up a hill is similar to splitting the nucleus, which then releases some of that energy.
Some atoms have unstable nuclei, which means that they tend to separate with little or no excitation.
The surface of the moon is made up of rock and dust. The outer layer of the moon is called the crust.
The outer crust is about 70 kilometers thick on the near side and 100 kilometers thick on the far side.
It is thinner in the water and thicker in the mountains.
There may be more eruptions on this side because the outer crust is thinner. It was easier for the lava to break through to the surface.
Content theories focus on discovering what drives people to make choices or what makes them feel committed.
These theories suggest that humans have certain needs and/or desires that have been internalized as they mature.
These theories aim to determine what drives certain individuals to want to do the things they do, and what environmental factors might encourage or discourage them from taking certain actions.
Two well-known theories of content are Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs and Herzberg's Two-Factor Theory.
In general, two behaviors can emerge when managers start to manage their former peers: one end of the spectrum is trying to remain one of the "first among the guys (or girls)".
This type of leader has difficulty in making unpopular decisions, implementing disciplinary actions, conducting performance reviews, assigning responsibilities, and holding people accountable.
On the other end of the spectrum, a creature is transformed into an unrecognizable individual who feels compelled to change everything that the team has done and take its own steps.
Ultimately, the leader is responsible for the success or failure of the team.
This behavior often creates tension between leaders and the rest of the team.
Virtual teams are held to the same standards of excellence as conventional teams, but there are subtle differences.
Members of virtual teams often serve as the point of contact for their immediate physical group.
They often have more autonomy than regular team members because their teams can meet across different time zones, which can be confusing for their local management.
The presence of a real 'invisible team' (Larson and LaFasto, 1989, p.109) is also a unique component of a virtual team.
The invisible team is the leadership team to which each member reports. The invisible team sets benchmarks for each member.
Why would an organization want to go through the time-consuming process of establishing an educational organization? One of the goals of implementing organizational learning principles in practice is innovation.
Creativity and opportunity can emerge when all available resources in the functional operational departments of an organization are utilized effectively.
As a result, the process of an organization working together to overcome a barrier can lead to a new innovative process that serves the needs of the customer.
Before any organization can become innovative, leadership must create a culture of innovation, as well as shared knowledge and organizational learning.
Angel (2006) explains the Continuous Approach as a method used to help organizations achieve higher levels of performance.
Neuroscience data provides physical evidence to support a theoretical approach to cognitive research, thus narrowing the field of study and making it much more precise.
The reciprocal relationship between brain pathology and behavior supports scientists in their research.
It has long been known that different types of brain damage, trauma, infections, and tumors affect behavior and alter some mental functions.
The growth of new technology is allowing us to see and examine the structure and processes of the brain in ways we have never seen before.
This provides us with a wealth of information and materials to build models that help us understand the processes in our minds.
Although artificial intelligence has strong science fiction connotations, it is a very important branch of computer science that deals with behavior, learning, and the adaptation of devices in a smart way.
Artificial intelligence research includes developing machines to automate tasks that require intelligent behavior.
Examples include monitoring, programming and organization, the ability to respond to customer diagnoses and inquiries, as well as handwriting, voice, and facial recognition.
These things become distinct scientific disciplines that focus on providing solutions to real-life problems.
Artificial Intelligence is now frequently used in economics, medicine, engineering, and the military, as it has been integrated into several computer and video game software applications.
Field trips are a big part of any course and often a teacher would like to take their students to places that are not accessible by bus.
Technology provides a solution with virtual field trips. Students can view cultural artifacts in a museum, visit aquariums or appreciate beautiful art while sitting in their classrooms.
Sharing about the excursion is also a good means of reflecting on the trip and sharing experiences with future classes.
For instance, every year the students at Bennett School in North Carolina create a website about their trip to the state capital. The website is updated annually, but old versions are kept online as a record.
Blogs can also be useful in improving students' writing. While students often start their blogging journey with poor grammar and spelling, the presence of readers mainly changes this.
Since students are often the most critical readers, the blogger struggles to improve their writing to avoid criticism.
Blogging also "makes students more aware of the world around them." The need to satisfy the audience's curiosity inspires students to be intelligent and curious (Toto, 2004).
Blogging is a tool that promotes collaboration and encourages students to extend their learning beyond the boundaries of the traditional school day.
The normal use of blogs can empower students to become more analytical and critical: by responding more actively to online material, students can define their positions in the context of other writers' writings, as well as on certain issues in order to outline their own perspectives (O'Rae, 2002).
Ottawa is the charming and bilingual capital of Canada, adorned with art galleries and museums that showcase the country's past and present.
To the south are the Niagara Falls, and to the north is the natural beauty of Muskoka and the surrounding areas.
All this and a few other things highlight Ontario as what is considered by outsiders to be an exemplary Canadian city.
Large areas further north are sparsely populated, while some are virtually uninhabited deserts.
To compare the population, which surprises many, there are more African Americans living in the United States than there are Canadian citizens.
The East African Islands are in the Indian Ocean, off the east coast of Africa.
Madagascar, silent, is the largest, and in terms of the region's wildlife, a unique continent.
Many of the smaller islands are either independent nations or linked to France and are known for their beautiful beaches for vacationing.
The Arabs also brought Islam to these countries and it has come a long way in the Comoros and Mayotte.
European influence and colonization began in the 15th century when the Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama discovered the sea route from Europe to India.
To the north, the region is bordered by the Sahel, and to the south and west, by the Atlantic Ocean.
Women: It is advised that any woman traveler should say she is married, regardless of her actual marital status.
Wearing a ring is also helpful (just not one that is excessively expensive).
Women need to be aware that cultural differences may result in behavior that they would consider harassment, and it is not unusual for them to be followed, pulled by the hand, etc.
Be confident in rejecting men and don’t be afraid to speak your mind (whether it’s a cultural difference or not, right?).
The modern city of Casablanca was founded by Berber fishermen in the 10th century BC, and the Phoenicians, Romans and Merenids used it as a strategic port called Anfa.
The Portuguese destroyed and rebuilt it as Casa Branca only to abandon it after the earthquake of 1755.
The Sultan of Morocco rebuilt the city as Daru l-Badia, while Spanish merchants who were establishing trading bases there gave it the name Casablanca.
From a shopping perspective, Casablanca is one of the least interesting places in Morocco.
It is not difficult to find places in Medina that sell traditional Moroccan items such as tajines, clay pots, leather goods, argan oil, and a wide variety of spices, but it is all catered to tourists.
Goma is a tourist town in the easternmost part of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, adjacent to Rwanda.
In 2002, the Nyiragongo volcanic eruption devastated Goma, covering most of the city's streets, particularly the city center.
While Goma is relatively safe, any travel outside of Goma must be researched to understand the situation of the ongoing military operations in North Kivu province.
The city is also the starting point for climbing the Nyiragongo volcano, which offers some of the most affordable mountain gorilla trekking in Africa.
To get around Goma, you can use a boda-boda (motorcycle taxi). The usual (local) price for a short ride is ~500 Congolese francs.
"Timbuktu" was used as a metaphor for exotic, distant lands due to its relative inaccessibility.
Today, Timbuktu is a poor city, although its reputation makes it attractive to tourists and it has an airport.
In 1990 it was added to the List of World Heritage in Danger due to the threat of desert sands.
It was one of Henry Lewis's main stops during the PBS special "Wonders of the African World."
The city is in stark contrast to other cities in the country, because it has more of an Arab flavor than African.
The Kruger National Park is situated in the northeast of South Africa and stretches east along the border with Mozambique, north to Zimbabwe and south to the Crocodile River.
The park covers an area of 19,500 square kilometers and is divided into 14 different ecoregions, each supporting different branches of wildlife.
It is one of the main tourist attractions in South Africa and is regarded as the flagship of South African National Parks (SANParks).
As with all national parks in South Africa, there are daily conservation and entrance fees.
It may also be worthwhile to purchase a Wild Card, which grants access to various parks in South Africa or the entire South African National Park.
Hong Kong Island gives its name to the Hong Kong territory and is the primary attraction for many tourists.
The parade of buildings that make up the Hong Kong skyline resembles a glittering pattern, made visible by the presence of Victoria Harbour waters.
To see the best sights of Hong Kong, let's leave the island and head to the opposite side, to Kowloon Falls.
The majority of Hong Kong Island's urban development is concentrated in the reclaimed lands along the northern shore, which is densely populated.
This is the location where British colonists observed their own, so if you're looking for evidence of this place's colonial past, this is a good place to start.
The Sundarbans is the world's largest mangrove belt, extending 80 km (50 mi) from the coast and spanning the inland areas of Bangladesh and India.
The Sundarbans have been declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The forested area within the Indian Territory is known as the Sundarbans National Park.
However, the forests are not only mangrove swamps. They include the last remnants of the mighty jungles that once covered the Gangetic Plain.
The Sundarbans area covers 3,850 square kilometers, of which about one-third is covered by water/saline sections.
Since 1966, the Sundarbans have been a wildlife sanctuary, and by rough estimates, there are 400 Royal Bengal tigers and around 30,000 spotted deer in the area.
Buses depart from the intercity bus station (along the river) throughout the day, although the eastbound and Jakarta/Bumintang trains depart between 06:30-07:30.
Since intercity buses are often crowded, it is recommended to buy a ticket a few days in advance.
Many areas are served by small Japanese coastal buses which are comfortable and reliable.
Shared taxis are a fast and convenient means to visit nearby places, like Paro (Nu 150) and Punakha (Nu 200).
The Oiapoque River Bridge is a cable-stayed bridge that spans the Oiapoque River and connects the city of Oiapoque, Brazil with Saint-Georges-de-l'Oiapoque, French Guiana.
The two towers reach a height of 83 meters, its length is 378 meters, and it has two rows that are 3.5 meters wide.
The vertical clearance below the bridge is 15 meters. Construction was completed in August 2011, but it was closed to traffic until March 2017.
The bridge is expected to be fully operational by September 2017, when Brazil's customs work is expected to be completed.
The Guarani were the most significant indigenous group living in what is now Eastern Paraguay, living as semi-nomadic hunters who engaged in subsistence agriculture to support their livelihood.
The Chaco region was also inhabited by other indigenous groups such as the Guaicuru and the Paagua, who survived by hunting, gathering and fishing.
16th-century Paraguay, formerly known as the "Land of Indian Surveillance", was created as a result of the clash between Spanish conquistadors and native Indian tribes.
The Spanish began a period of colonization that lasted for three centuries.
When Asunción was founded in 1537, Paraguay was able to largely preserve its native character and identity.
Argentina is known as one of the countries with the best polo team and players in the world.
The biggest tournament of the year takes place in December at the Las Canitas Polo Grounds.
Smaller tournaments and meetings are also held here on the other days of the year.
For information on where to buy tickets for tournaments and polo games, see the Argentine Polo Association.
The official currency of the Falklands is the Falkland Pound (FKP), which is equivalent to the British Pound (GBP).
Money can be exchanged at the only bank on the islands, located in Stanley across from the Falkland Islands Company's Western Shop.
The British pound sterling is generally accepted anywhere in the islands, as are Stanley credit cards. United States dollars are also often accepted.
Credit cards may not be accepted on remote islands, but British and US currency may be accepted. Check with owners in advance to see what payment method is acceptable.
It is nearly impossible to exchange Falkland currency outside of the islands, so make sure to exchange your money before leaving the islands.
Because Montevideo is south of the equator, it is summer there when it is winter in the northern hemisphere, and vice versa.
Montevideo is in the subtropics, with temperatures above +30 C in the summer months being common.
Winter can be deceptively cold - the temperature rarely drops below zero, but the wind and humidity combine to make it feel colder than the thermometer indicates.
There aren't any specific "rainy" or "dry" seasons. According to rough calculations, the amount of rainfall remains the same throughout the year.
Despite the fact that many animals in the park are accustomed to seeing people, the wildlife is native to the area and should not be fed or disturbed.
According to the park's management, you must maintain a minimum distance of 100 yards from bears and wolves, and 25 yards from all other wildlife.
As docile as they may seem, bison, reindeer, badgers, bears and almost any other large animal can attack.
Every year, dozens of visitors are injured because they did not keep a safe distance. These animals are large, wild, and potentially dangerous, so give them their space.
Also, be aware that bears and other wild animals are attracted to smells, so avoid having or preparing smelly food and keep the camp clean.
Apia is the capital of Samoa. It is located on the island of Upolu and its population is less than 40,000.
Apia was founded in the 1850s and has been the official capital of Samoa since 1959.
The harbor was the site of a notorious naval standoff in 1889 when seven ships from Germany, the United States, and Britain refused to leave the harbor.
All ships were sunk except for one British warship. About 200 Americans and Germans were killed.
As a result of peaceful rallies in the city during the independence struggle organized by the Maoist movement, Supreme Leader Tupua Tamasese Lealofi III was killed.
There are many beaches in Auckland due to the two harbors that surround it on both sides. The most famous ones are in three areas.
The North Shore beaches (in the North Harbour region) are on the Pacific coast and stretch from Long Bay in the north to Devonport in the south.
All of them are safe sandy beaches to swim and most have shaded areas provided by pohutukawa trees.
Tamaki Drive's beaches are situated on the Waitemata Harbour, in the upscale suburbs of Central Auckland's Mission Bay and St Heliers.
Sometimes these are bustling family beaches, with many different kinds of shops along the shore. The beach is safe.
The main local beer is "Number One", it is a simple beer but has a pleasant and refreshing character. The other local beer is called "Manta".
There are many French wines to have, but New Zealand and Australian wines may be better to consume.
The local tap water is perfectly safe to drink, but if you're concerned, bottled water is easy to find.
For Australians, the concept of coffee with milk is foreign. A "short black" is an espresso, cappuccino is served with a lot of foam (not with powder), and tea is served without milk.
Hot chocolate is even by Belgian standards. The fruit juices are expensive, but they have a great taste.
Many underwater cave expeditions are conducted year-round, and damage to underwater reefs for any of these reasons is very rare.
As always, listen to the authorities' advice, obey all signs, and be vigilant of safety signals.
Box jellyfish are found near beaches and riverbanks from October to April north of 1770, and occasionally outside of these times.
Sharks do indeed exist, but they rarely attack humans. Many sharks are afraid of people and swim away from the shore.
Sea crocodiles don't only live in the ocean, their primary habitat is the riverbanks north of Rockhampton.
Booking in advance gives travelers peace of mind, knowing that they will have a place to sleep upon reaching their destination.
Travel agents often make deals with specific hotels, although you can also book other types of accommodation, such as camping, through a travel agent.
Travel agents commonly offer packages that include breakfast, airport transfers, or even a combination flight and hotel package.
They can also hold your reservation if you need time to think about the offer or to obtain other documents (such as an entry visa) for your destination.
Any changes or inquiries should first be made through a travel agent, and not directly with the hotel.
For some festivals, a large majority of visitors opt to camp on site, and many visitors regard it as an integral part of the experience.
If you want to be near the concert, you have to enter early to pitch your tent near the music.
Keep in mind that, even if the music on the main stages has ended, there may still be parts of the festival that continue to play music late into the night.
Some festivals have special camping areas designated for families with young children.
If you decide to cross the northern Baltic in winter, check the cabin placement because going through ice can create a rather unpleasant noise for the most affected passengers.
Sailing in St. Petersburg also includes a city break. Cruise passengers are exempt from entry visa requirements (check the conditions).
Casinos typically go to great lengths to make guests spend more time and money. There are no clocks or windows, and the exits are hard to find.
They usually have special offers for food, drink and entertainment to keep their guests in high spirits and keep them inside the building.
Some places offer alcoholic drinks right at home. However, drunkenness impairs judgment, and all good gamblers know the importance of staying sober.
Anyone preparing to drive at high altitudes or over mountain passes should be mindful of snow, ice, or freezing temperatures.
Traction is low on icy and snow-covered roads, and you cannot drive as you would on bare asphalt.
In the case of a blizzard, a large amount of snow can fall in a very short time and cover you.
Visibility may also be limited by snow falling or melting on car windows or by fog or ice on them.
On the other hand, ice and snow conditions are normal in many countries, and traffic continues mostly uninterrupted throughout the year.
Safaris are probably the biggest draw for tourists to Africa and the goal for many visitors.
The term safari is widely used for overland travel to observe the spectacular African wildlife, particularly in the savannah.
Some animals, like elephants and leopards, often come close to vehicles, and standard equipment provides an opportunity to have a good close-up view of them.
Lions, leopards, and cheetahs can sometimes be shy, and it's easier to spot them through binoculars.
A safari (also known as a bush safari, bush trip, or overland) includes trips that can last for several hours or even several days.
The Paralympic Games will take place from August 24 to September 5, 2021. Several events will be held in other locations in Japan.
Tokyo is the only Asian city to have hosted two Summer Olympic Games, which were held in 1964.
If you have booked your tickets and accommodation for 2020 before the announcement of the delay, you may be facing a difficult situation.
Cancellation policies vary, but as of the end of March, all cancellations due to coronavirus will not be extended until July 2020, when the Olympics were scheduled to take place.
It is expected that tickets for many events will cost between 2,500 and 130,000 yen, while regular tickets will cost 7,000 yen.
Ironing your clothes will help to crease them. Many hotels have an iron and an ironing board that can be rented, even if there is no one in the room.
If a polish is not available or if you do not like wearing polished shoes, then, if possible, you could try a shoe shiner.
Be careful not to overheat the piece (which could cause burning or, in extreme cases, burns).
There are different ways to purify water, some of which are more effective for specific contaminants.
In some areas, boiling water for a minute is sufficient, while in others it takes several minutes to do so.
Filters differ in their effectiveness and if you are worried, you should consider buying your water from a reputable company that comes in a sealed bottle.
Travelers may encounter pests in their home environment that are unfamiliar to them.
Insects can spoil food, cause irritation, or worse, cause allergic reactions, spread poisons or transmit diseases.
Infectious diseases themselves or dangerous animals that can harm or violently kill people are not usually classified as pests.
Duty-free shopping allows you to purchase goods free of taxes and excise duties in certain places.
Travelers to countries with heavy taxation can sometimes save a lot of money, especially on items such as liquor and tobacco.
The section between Point Marion and Fairmont represents the most dangerous driving conditions on the Buffalo-Pittsburgh highway, often passing through isolated deep forested terrain.
If you're not used to driving on rural roads, keep your senses sharp: Bumpy roads, narrow lanes and sharp turns are common.
The speed limits that are in place are significantly lower than in the previous and subsequent sections, at 35-40 mph (56-64 km/h), and it is more important to adhere to them than anything else.
Interestingly, cell phone service is much stronger here than in many other parts of the trail, for example in the Pennsylvania Wilderness.
German pastries are quite good, and in Bavaria, quite rich and varied. The same can be said for their southern neighbor, Austria.
Fruit pies are widespread, apple pies are made all year round, while caraway and salsa have their fresh breath during the summer.
Many German pastry dishes include nuts, walnuts, and other tree nuts. The popular biscuits often go well with a cup of strong coffee.
If you want a small but satisfying doughnut, try what is called a Berliner, Pfannkuchen, or Krapfen, depending on the region.
Curry is a dish whose main ingredients are herbs and spices, prepared either with meat or with vegetables.
The curry can be either "dry" or "wet" depending on the amount of sauce.

With the choice of around 17,000 islands, Indonesian cuisine is a general term that includes a wide variety of regional dishes that can be found throughout the country.
But when used without further qualifications, the term generally refers to food originating from the central and eastern parts of the main island of Java.
Now widely available throughout the archipelago, Javanese cuisine is defined by a simple, flavorful array of dishes with the predominant Javanese flavor additions being peanuts, black pepper, sugar (especially Javanese coconut sugar), and various flavorful spices.
The stirrups, which are attached on either side of the saddle, protect the rider's legs.
These provide greater stability for the rider, but may pose safety risks since there is a possibility that the rider's feet could get trapped in them.
If a rider falls off the horse but their foot remains in the stirrup, the horse may kick them if it runs away. To minimize this risk, a number of preventative measures can be taken.
Initially, all riders wear boots designed for riding, with heels and a flat and fairly narrow insole.
Some saddles, particularly English saddles, have safety stirrups that allow the rider's foot to easily disengage from the stirrup if the rider falls off the horse.
Cochamo Valley is Chile's premier destination for rock climbing, known as the Yosemite of South America for its variety of large granite rocks and boulders.
The cliffs offer stunning views from the top, and climbers from all over the world are constantly creating new routes through the potential of its endless walls.
Cross-country skiing and snowboarding are popular winter sports that involve skiing over snow-covered terrain either on skis or snowboards attached to your feet.
Skiing is a major travel activity for many enthusiastic people, known as "ski obsessives," who plan their entire vacation around skiing at a particular location.
The concept of skateboarding is very old, with cave paintings depicting skaters as far back as 5,000 years before the birth of Christ.
Skiing can be traced back to at least the 17th century, and in 1861 the first recreational ski club was opened in Australia by Norwegians.
Backpacking, this activity is also known as long-distance hiking, thru-hiking, or trekking.
It is associated with alpine-style skiing or mountaineering, but these are usually not included; the latter is done in more relaxed locations and requires much stronger skis and boots.
Think of the ski trail as a type of expedition trail.
Under good conditions, you may be able to cover more distance than walking, but only rarely will you be able to gather speed on a prepared track without carrying a heavy backpack.
Europe is a relatively small continent, but it contains many independent countries. Normally, traveling to several countries would involve applying for numerous entry visas and going through passport control procedures multiple times.
But in this respect, the Schengen area operates as one country.
As long as you remain in this zone, you can usually cross the border without having to go through passport control again.
Similarly, if you have a Schengen visa, there is no need to apply separately for a visa in each Schengen country, saving you time, money, and paperwork.
There is no universal definition of what is considered an antique, and some tax agencies classify items over 100 years old as antiques.
The definition varies by geographical location, where the age limit may be lower in North America than in Europe.
Craft items can be considered as antiques, even though they are newer than similar mass-produced products.
Reindeer farming is an important source of livelihood in the Sami and surrounding culture, and trade is also important for many other professions.
Even traditionally, not all Sami were involved in large-scale reindeer husbandry, but they did live off fishing, hunting and similar pursuits, keeping reindeer as the main breeding animal.
Today, many Sámi people work in modern trade. Tourism is an important source of income in Lapland, the Sámi region.
Although it is widely used, particularly among non-Roma, the word "Gypsy" is often considered derogatory because it is associated with negative stereotypes and misperceptions of the Roma people.
If the country you are visiting is subject to a travel advisory, this may affect your travel health insurance or your travel cancellation insurance.
You might also want to seek advice from other governments besides your own, but their advice is intended for their own citizens.
For example, American citizens in the Middle East may encounter various situations when dealing with Europeans or Arabs.
Written advice is only a rough summary of a country's political situation.
The views presented are very general and oversimplified compared to the more detailed information available elsewhere.
Severe weather is a general term for any dangerous weather event that has the potential to cause damage, serious social disruption or loss of human life.
Extreme weather can occur in any corner of the world, and there are various types that can be dependent on geography, topography, and atmospheric conditions.
Strong winds, hail, excessive rainfall, and forest fires are the forms and consequences of severe weather, such as storms, tornadoes, currents on the surface of water, and cyclones.
The regional and seasonal extreme weather phenomena include avalanches, blizzards, ice storms, and sandstorms.
Travelers are strongly advised to be aware of any severe weather hazards that may affect their area, as this may in turn affect their travel plans.
Anyone planning to visit a country that could be considered a war zone should receive professional training.
If you search the web for "Hostile Environment Training," you will likely find the address of a local company.
The course, as a rule, will present all the issues discussed here in much greater detail, usually with the help of practical experience.
The course typically lasts 2-5 days and includes role-playing, mostly information relating to first aid, and sometimes skills on handling weapons.
Books and magazines about survival in the desert are widespread, but there are few publications about war zones.
Travelers planning to undergo gender reassignment surgery abroad must ensure they have valid documentation for their return trip.
The willingness of governments to issue gender-neutral (X) passports or documents for updated desired name and gender matching varies.
The willingness of foreign governments to monitor the preservation of these documents is just as variable.
Since September 11, 2001, security checks at airports have become even more rigorous.
During the preoperative phase, transgenders should not expect to undergo scans and their privacy and dignity will remain inviolable.
Back currents are the backward flow of waves that form after they hit the shore, often after hitting a reef or something similar.
Due to the underwater topography, the returning flow is centered in a few deeper sections, and a strong current may arise in deep water.
Many deaths occur as a result of exhausting attempts to swim against the current, which may be impossible.
Once you're out of the current, swimming back is not as difficult as it usually is.
Try to find places where you won't be attacked again or, depending on your abilities and whether you have been seen, you may want to wait for help.
Rebound shock arrives sooner than culture shock (the honeymoon phase is shorter), lasts longer, and can be more severe.
Travelers who easily adjust to a new culture sometimes find it particularly difficult to re-adapt to their native culture.
When you return home after living abroad, when you have adapted to a new culture and lost some of your native customs.
When you first traveled abroad, people were probably patient and understanding, knowing that travelers in a new country need to adjust.
People may not realize that patience and understanding are also needed for travelers returning home.
One of the most interesting things in the children's section is the sound and light show.
In the dark, you can see the pyramids and you can see them in the silence before the performance starts.
You usually hear the voices of tourists and merchants all the time, and the story of sound and light is just like a storybook.
Swinks is positioned as a narrator and the teller of a long story.
The scenes are projected onto the pyramids and then the different pyramids are illuminated.
Discovered in 1819, the South Shetland Islands are claimed by several countries and have the largest number of bases, sixteen of which are active as of 2020.
The archipelago is located 120 km north of the peninsula. The largest island is King George Island, located in the Villa las Estrellas settlement.
Others include Livingston Island and Deception Island, where the still-active volcanic crater creates a magnificent natural harbor view.
Ellsworth Land is the southern region of the peninsula, surrounded by the Bellingshausen Sea.
The mountains of the peninsula here merge, become a plateau, then regroup to form the 360 km long Ellsworth Mountains, bisected by the Minnesota Glacier.
The northern part of the Sentinel Range in Antarctica is home to the continent's highest peaks, the Vinson Massif, whose highest point is Mount Vinson at 4,892 meters (16,050 feet).
In remote areas where there is no cellular coverage, a satellite phone may be your only option.
Generally, a satellite phone is not a replacement for a mobile phone because to make calls, you need to be in an open area with a clear view of the sky.
The service is frequently used for freight transportation, including yachts, as well as for expeditions, whose data is received remotely and who have voice communication needs.
Your local telephone service provider should be able to give you more information about subscribing to this service.
Traveling and learning is becoming a more popular option for older programmers.
This is particularly popular among graduates, allowing them to take a year off before college without interrupting their education.
In many cases, by participating in an exchange program abroad, you can actually improve your chances of transferring to a top educational institution in your home country.
Usually there's a tuition fee to enroll in these educational programs.
Finland is a major shipping terminal. The "land of a thousand lakes" also has thousands of islands in its lakes and offshore archipelagos.
It is not strictly necessary to have a boat in the archipelago and on the lakes.
Although the offshore islands and largest lakes are indeed big enough for any cruise ship, smaller boats or even lighthouses provide a completely different experience.
Sailing is considered a national pastime in Finland, with seven or eight people on each boat.
It corresponds to Norway, Sweden and New Zealand, but is quite exceptional in the rest of the cases (for example, in the Netherlands the ratio is one in forty).
A feature of most memorable Baltic sea voyages is the long stop in St. Petersburg, Russia.
This means you can visit the historic city for two full days while returning and sleeping on the boat at night.
If you only go ashore for boat excursions, then you do not need a separate visa (as of 2009).
Some brochures depict the city of Berlin, Germany. As you can see on the map above, there is no sea near Berlin, and a visit to the city is not included in the cost of the cruise.
Flying can be a frightening experience for people of all ages and backgrounds, especially if they have never flown before or have experienced an accident.
There's nothing to be ashamed of. It's no different than personal fears and other dislikes that many people have.
For some, understanding something about how an airplane works and what happens during flight can help overcome fear that is based on unknown or uncontrollable phenomena.
Freight companies are well paid to deliver goods quickly. Time is often critical for business documents, trade, or emergency repair parts.
In some areas, the larger companies have their own planes, but for other areas and smaller firms, this has been a problem.
If they send the products by air, it can take days to pass through customs and unloading on certain routes.
The only way to get it faster was to send it as checked baggage. Airline regulations would not allow them to send their baggage to the country they were visiting without a passenger.
The obvious way to fly first or business class is to spend a lot of money for the privilege (or better yet, get your company to do it for you).
However, it's not cheap. Practically speaking, you can expect to pay up to four times more for business class than for economy class and eleven times more for first class.
In general, it doesn't even make sense to look for discounts on direct business flights or first-class seats to get from point A to point B.
Airlines know very well that there is a certain core group of travelers who are willing to pay a lot of money for the benefit of getting somewhere quickly and comfortably, and they charge accordingly.
Chisinau is the capital of Moldova. The local language is Romanian, but Russian is widely used.
Moldova is a multiethnic republic that has been plagued by national conflicts.
In 1994, this conflict resulted in the creation of the self-proclaimed Transnistrian Republic in eastern Moldova, which has its own government and currency, but has not been recognized by any UN member state.
Despite the failed political negotiations, economic ties between these two regions of Moldova have been re-established.
The main religion in Moldova is Orthodox Christianity.

Once the ancient city of Smyrna, it is now a modern, thriving commercial center, centered around a large bay and surrounded by mountains.
The wide streets, glass-fronted buildings, and modern shopping centers are contrasted with traditional red tiled roofs, an 18th-century market, old mosques, and churches, although the city has more of a Mediterranean European flair than a traditional Turkish one.
The village of Halldarsvik offers views of the nearby island of Esturoy and has an unusual octagonal church.

Please treat the site with the dignity, respect, and reverence it deserves. Do not joke about the Holocaust or Nazi themes.
Do not deface the site by carving signs or inscriptions on structures.
The official languages of Barcelona are Catalan and Spanish. Almost half of the population prefers to speak Catalan, a vast majority understands it, and virtually everyone speaks Spanish.
However, many signs are only in Catalan as it is established by law as the first official language.
Furthermore, Spanish is also widely used in public transportation and other institutions.
In the metro, normal announcements are only made in Catalan, but unscheduled outages are announced by the automated system in a number of languages including Spanish, English, French, Arabic, and Japanese.
Parisians have a reputation for being self-centered, rude, and conceited.
While this is often just a stereotype, the best way to fit in Paris is to show your character by acting like someone who is "well-mannered." This will make it much easier to fit in.
The aloofness of Parisians will quickly fade away if you show some of the basic signs of politeness.
The Plitvice Lakes Park is a dense forest primarily of evergreen, coniferous and oak trees, and is a mixture of alpine and Mediterranean vegetation.
It has a remarkably wide diversity of plant communities due to its range of microclimates, different soil types and different levels of elevation.
The area is also home to a variety of animals and birds.
There, one can encounter rare species such as the brown bear, wolf, eagle, bee, moose, wildcat, and hare, as well as many other, more common species.
When visiting monasteries, women must wear dresses that cover their knees and also cover their shoulders.
Most monasteries provide scarves for women who come unprepared, but if you bring your own, especially in bright colors, you will be greeted at the entrance by a monk or a nun.
Men are also required to wear trousers that cover their knees.
These garments can also be borrowed from the store near the entrance, but they are not washed after each use, so you will not feel comfortable wearing these half-garments. One size fits all men.
Mallorcan cuisine is similar to that of the Mediterranean, based on bread, vegetables, and meat (especially pork) with the use of olive oil in everything.
Pa amb oli is a simple evening meal, especially in summer, with olive oil bread, tomatoes and any seasoning such as cheese, tuna fish, etc.
All nouns, including the word Sie (formal "you" in German), always begin with a capital letter, even in the middle of a sentence.
This is an important method for distinguishing between certain verbs and direct problems.
In a controversial way, it also makes it easier to read, although writing can be somewhat tricky when you have to determine if a verb or adverb is used in a noun form.
Pronunciation is relatively easier in Italian because many words are pronounced exactly as they are written.
You have to be careful with the letters "si" and "ji" because their pronunciation varies depending on the vowel that follows them.
Also, ensure that you pronounce the r and rr differently: "caro" means "dear" while "carro" means "car".
Persian has a relatively simple and mostly regular grammar.
Nevertheless, reading this basic grammar book will help you learn a lot about Persian grammar and better understand expressions.

However, people who know a little Spanish may hastily conclude that Portuguese is quite similar to Spanish, and that there is no need to learn it separately.
Pre-modern observatories are now generally disused and serve as museums or educational sites.
Since light pollution was not as much of a problem in the past as it is today, they are usually located in cities or college campuses, where they are easier to access than those built in our times.
The most advanced research telescopes are huge structures in remote locations with favorable atmospheric conditions.
The viewing of cherry blossoms, known as hanami, has been a part of Japanese culture since the 8th century.
The idea came from China, where they preferred lotus flowers.
In Japan, the first flower-viewing parties were held by the emperor himself, with other members of the aristocracy around the imperial court.
Plants thrive best in their natural environment, so resist the temptation to pick even just one specimen.
If you visit an officially designated park, collecting "specimens" without discussion will also land you in trouble.
Singapore is generally an extremely safe place, and it's very easy to get around, and after arriving, you can buy pretty much anything.
However, being located in the "high tropics," a few degrees north of the equator, you will have to deal with both heat (always) and intense sunshine (when the sky is clear, most often).
There are also several buses that go north to Hebron, which is the traditional burial place of the biblical patriarchs Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, and their wives.
Make sure the bus you're about to board takes you to Hebron, not the nearby Jewish settlement of Kiryat Arba.

Many of the traditions around the holiday have also been adopted by non-Christians in Christian countries and by non-Christians around the world.
There is a tradition of staying up on Easter night to see the sunrise at a certain vantage point.
Of course, there are Christian and theological explanations for this tradition, but it is very likely that it was a pre-Christian spring and fertility rite.
More traditional churches hold events on Easter weekend, Saturday night, for the Easter Vigil, where communities often begin to celebrate Christ's resurrection as midnight strikes.
Initially, all animals that arrived on the islands came either by swimming, flying, or by the current of the water.
Due to their great distance from the mainland, mammals were unable to migrate, and as a result, the giant tortoise became the primary herbivore of the Galapagos.
Since humans set foot on the Galapagos Islands, many mammals have been introduced, including goats, horses, cows, rats, and dogs.
If you visit the Arctic or Antarctic regions during winter, you'll see the polar night, which means that the sun doesn't rise above the horizon.
This provides a good opportunity to see the Northern Lights, when the night sky is mostly clear.
Since the areas are sparsely populated, and light pollution is not often a problem, you can also admire the stars.
Japanese work culture is more hierarchical and formal than what Westerners are accustomed to.
The attire is typically business formal, and colleagues address each other by last name or job title.
Harmony in the workplace is very important, emphasizing team efforts more than individual achievements.
