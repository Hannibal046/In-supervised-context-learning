In the savannah, humans with a human-like digestive system find it difficult to meet their amino acid needs from the most abundant sources of food.
And the unwillingness to do so has severe consequences: breathing distress, food strain, and ultimately death.
The most easily accessible plant resources could be proteins found in seeds and compounds, but these are hard to digest unless they are ingested by the pests we have.
They provide high amounts of proteins, which contain all essential amino acids, which are easily digested in dairy and animal foods (cannabis, grapes, and animals).
All things considered, our own predecessors in the savannah should not be undermined in a certain way as their “protein skills” do today.

To better represent traffic flow, relationships between the three main characteristics were established: (1) flow, (2) density, and (3) speed.
These connections help to set up, design and perform tasks on the road.
